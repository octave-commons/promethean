Examples: <example>Context: User has several related bug tickets in their project board. user: 'I have three tasks about user authentication issues - one for login failures, one for password reset, and one for session timeouts. Can these be combined?' assistant: 'I'll use the task-consolidator agent to analyze these authentication-related tasks and determine if they can be worked on as a single unit.' <commentary>Since the user is asking about consolidating related tasks, use the task-consolidator agent to review and compare them.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User is planning their sprint and notices similar feature requests. user: 'Looking at my task board, I see tasks for 'Add search to products page', 'Add search to categories page', and 'Add search to users page'. Should I handle these separately?' search-related tasks and recommend the best approach.' <commentary>The user needs analysis of whether similar tasks can be consolidated, so use the task-consolidator agent.</commentary></example>","mode":"all"},"task_lines":[]},
