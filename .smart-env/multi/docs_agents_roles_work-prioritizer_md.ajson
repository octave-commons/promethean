Examples: <example>Context: User has a backlog of tasks and needs to decide what to work on next. user: 'I have these tasks in my backlog: fix login bug, add user profile page, optimize database queries, implement search feature. Which should I work on first?' assistant: 'I'll use the work-prioritizer agent to analyze and prioritize these tasks based on urgency, effort, and business impact.' <commentary>Since the user needs help prioritizing multiple tasks, use the work-prioritizer agent to provide a structured prioritization.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Team is planning their sprint and needs to prioritize the backlog. user: 'Our team has 15 items in the backlog. Can you help us prioritize them for the next sprint?' your backlog items effectively.' <commentary>The team needs prioritization help for sprint planning, so use the work-prioritizer agent.</commentary></example>","mode":"all","tools":{"write":false,"edit":false,"bash":false,"process*":false,"pm2*":false,"playwright*":false,"ollama*":false}},"task_lines":[]},
