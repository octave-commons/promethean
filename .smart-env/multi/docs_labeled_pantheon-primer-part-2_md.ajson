document provides a practical guide to system design using narrow tasks, heavy tool usage, and batching techniques. It includes mathematical models for night throughput, peer review acceptance rates, and specialization learning curves. The focus is on deterministic workflows with strict tooling and artifact contracts to ensure reliability and efficiency.","tags":["#system_design","#mathematical_models","#peer_review","#tool_batching","#deterministic_workflows","#artifact_contracts","#specialization_learning","#night_runs"]},"task_lines":[]},
