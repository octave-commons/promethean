It emphasizes how minor interventions are handled without halting workflow, while major issues trigger full team coordination. The process avoids rigid gates and focuses on natural workflow progression.","tags":["#kanban","#finite state machine","#workflow","#blocking conditions","#minor intervention","#major intervention","#process flow","#transition rules"]},"task_lines":[]},
