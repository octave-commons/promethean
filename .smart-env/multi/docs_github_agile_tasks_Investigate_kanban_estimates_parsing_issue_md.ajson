Audit frontmatter format vs working tasks\\n2. Test estimates parsing with different formats\\n3. Check kanban package estimate reading logic\\n4. Verify YAML parsing in task files\\n5. Test transition rules with debug output\\n\\n### Expected Outcome\\n- Identify root cause of estimates not being read\\n- Fix parsing issue or update format requirements\\n- Enable breakdown tasks to move to ready column\\n- Clear breakdown bottleneck":[15,16],"##⛓️ Blocked By":[17,22],"##⛓️ Blocked By#{1}":[19,22],"##⛓️ Blocks":[23,26],"##⛓️ Blocks#{1}":[25,26]},"outlinks":[],"metadata":{"uuid":"63170945-c1e5-488e-886a-9a38624274b5","title":"Investigate kanban estimates parsing issue","slug":"Investigate kanban estimates parsing issue","status":"todo","priority":"P1","labels":["estimates","parsing","kanban","investigate"],"created_at":"2025-10-13T20:02:44.194Z","estimates":{"complexity":"","scale":"","time_to_completion":""}},"task_lines":[]},
