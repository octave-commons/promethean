How do I remove them from the entire history?' assistant: 'I'll use the git-history-recovery agent to help you safely remove those sensitive credentials from your commit history.' <commentary>The user has a critical Git history issue that requires expert intervention to remove sensitive data from the repository history.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has a messy commit history with lots of 'fix typo' and 'wip' commits that need to be cleaned up before a PR. user: 'My feature branch has 50 small commits with terrible messages. How can I squash them into meaningful commits before creating a pull request?' assistant: 'Let me use the git-history-recovery agent to help you clean up and organize those commits into a professional history.' <commentary>This requires Git history rewriting expertise to consolidate multiple commits into meaningful ones.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User merged the wrong branch or needs to undo a problematic merge. user: 'I accidentally merged the develop branch into main and it broke everything.
