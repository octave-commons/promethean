Moved 4 high-priority tasks from testing/in_progress to todo\\n2. Created 4 strategic tasks to address systemic issues\\n3. Identified critical estimates parsing problem\\n4. Documented breakdown completion requirements\\n\\n### Lessons Learned\\n- Transition rules require specific estimate formats\\n- Board flow optimization requires multi-column coordination\\n- System issues can block process compliance\\n- Creating strategic tasks helps address root causes\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n1. Fix estimates parsing to enable breakdown flow\\n2. Complete P0 security task breakdowns\\n3. Optimize WIP limits if needed\\n4. Document improved processes\\n\\n### Success Metrics\\n- Todo column at capacity (25/25)\\n- Breakdown bottleneck identified and addressed\\n- Systemic issues documented with solutions\\n- Process compliance maintained":[15,16],"##⛓️ Blocked By":[17,22],"##⛓️ Blocked By#{1}":[19,22],"##⛓️ Blocks":[23,26],"##⛓️ Blocks#{1}":[25,26]},"outlinks":[],"metadata":{"uuid":"de92d39f-eabb-4da3-ba02-4947f4a1f168","title":"Document kanban process improvements and lessons learned","slug":"Document kanban process improvements and lessons learned","status":"todo","priority":"P2","labels":["kanban","process","improvements","lessons"],"created_at":"2025-10-13T20:03:02.423Z","estimates":{"complexity":"","scale":"","time_to_completion":""}},"task_lines":[]},
