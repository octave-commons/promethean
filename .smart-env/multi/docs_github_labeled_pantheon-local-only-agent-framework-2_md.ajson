Framework","description":"A TypeScript-first, functional programming-oriented framework that enforces strict local-only operations during night runs, with no cloud fallback. It defines agents, tools, and flows as code, runs scheduled local jobs overnight, collects traces for training, and iteratively specializes small models using LoRA/QLoRA.","tags":["#TypeScript","#FP","#local-only","#LoRA","#training","#agent framework","#cloud fallback","#night runs"]},"task_lines":[]},
