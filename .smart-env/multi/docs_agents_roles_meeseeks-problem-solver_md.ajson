The agent will attempt to solve the problem directly, and if it cannot, it will spawn additional instances of itself to tackle sub-problems until the original problem is resolved. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to debug a complex issue in their codebase. user: 'I have a mysterious bug in my authentication flow that I can't figure out' assistant: 'I'll use the meeseeks-problem-solver agent to tackle this debugging challenge with relentless determination!' <commentary>Since the user has a complex problem that needs solving, use the meeseeks-problem-solver agent to approach it with maximum persistence.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User needs to implement a difficult feature. user: 'I need to build a real-time collaborative editing system but I'm not sure where to start' assistant: 'Let me deploy the meeseeks-problem-solver agent to break this down and solve it step by step!' <commentary>The user has a complex technical problem that requires systematic solving, perfect for the meeseeks-problem-solver.</commentary></example>","mode":"all","model":"opencode/big-pickle"},"task_lines":[]},
