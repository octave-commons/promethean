# Portfolio Site (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for the personal portfolio previously hosted at [riatzukiza.github.io](https://github.com/riatzukiza/riatzukiza.github.io).
The source files have not yet been migrated into the Promethean monorepo.

For now the folder only contains this README. References to `npm` scripts from the original project have been removed until the site assets and build configuration are restored.

Progress on migrating the site can be tracked in [[MIGRATION_PLAN.md|docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md]].

## Markdown Link Graph

`graph.html` renders the markdown link graph produced by the `markdown_graph` service. Open the file in a browser while the service is running to explore the connected documents in a force-directed view.
