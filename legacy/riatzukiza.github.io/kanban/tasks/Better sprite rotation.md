# Description

The current implementation of sprite rotations uses trig, I was getting frustrated and wwanted somthing that "worked", and I wasn't understanding the matrix code. The current version of [[sprites.md]] has artifacts around the edges if the image has pixels close to the edge.

## Related Epics
- [[Graphics.md]]
## Requirements

- Uses rotation matrix
- Demonstrate higher performance than current implementation

## Tasks 

- [ ] Write new shader 
- [ ] Writer new component system
- [ ] Write a new [[project.md]] that spawns a lot of [[sprites.md]] to compare the performance of the current implementation, the old implementation, and the new implementation.
