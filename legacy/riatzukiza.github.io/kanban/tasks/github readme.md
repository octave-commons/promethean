# Github Readme

Pretty straight forward, github needs a [[readme.md]] to explain to everyone coming to the code from github to understand what this repository is. I want to generate the [[readme.md]] from a collection of documents like this one.

## Requirements

- introduction
- this kanban is a part of it
- A link to the [[Home page.md]]
- A link to the projects
- A brief explaination of [[each.md]] [[project.md]]
