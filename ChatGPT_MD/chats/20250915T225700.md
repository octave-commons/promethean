# Get all existing pipelines functional
We've started working on several pipelines but only one of them works to any meaningful extant.
Most of them were set up before I thought about a "piper".
They may kinda work when ran in isolation.
but they do not work with piper

Okay, this is a good starting point. It seems like you've inherited a complex set of pipelines and are trying to get them all working with a "piper" system. Let's focus on troubleshooting.

Given the list, it appears there are several potential issues. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, along with some suggestions:

1.  **Investigate the "Piper" System:**  The core problem is that these pipelines aren't working *with* the piper system.  We need to understand *how* the piper system is supposed to be used and what dependencies it has.  Can you share the documentation or configuration for the piper system?  Knowing how it's intended to orchestrate these pipelines is crucial.

2.  **Isolate and Test:**  Let's start by testing each pipeline individually to see if they function correctly when run outside of the piper system.  This will help us determine if the problem is with the pipeline itself or with the integration with the piper.

3.  **Dependency Review:**  Each pipeline likely has dependencies – perhaps on specific tools, services, or other notes within your vault. Make a list of all dependencies for each pipeline and ensure they are accessible and correctly configured.

4.  **Version Compatibility:** Are there any version compatibility issues between the pipelines and the piper system?  Sometimes older pipelines won't work with newer systems.

5.  **Configuration Review:** Carefully examine the configuration files for each pipeline.  Are there any incorrect settings or missing parameters?

Here's a table summarizing the pipelines and a potential next step for each:

| Pipeline Name     | Status    | Next Steps                               |
|------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `symdocs`        | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `simtasks`       | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `codemods`        | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `semver-guard`    | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `board-review`   | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `sonar`          | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `readmes`        | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `buildfix`       | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `test-gap`        | Non-working| Investigate configuration and dependencies |
| `docops`          | Working   | Monitor and ensure continued functionality |
To help me assist you further, could you provide a little more information? Specifically:

*   Can you describe the "piper" system in more detail? (e.g., is it a script, a tool, or a plugin?)
*   Do you have any logs or error messages related to the failing pipelines?

Piper is a cli i wrote that reads a pipeline json config file that has a bunch of pipeline definitions you can run inside of it.

The pipelines contain the inputs, outputs, and executor (either a js/ts module, or a shell command), and the steps required to have been previously successful for another that start to execute.

It's meant to be a resliant ML pipeline running, with each step defining schemas/contracts that must be fulfiled before the system can move forward to the next step.

Okay, that’s incredibly helpful! A CLI that reads JSON pipeline configurations and enforces schemas – that clarifies a *lot*. Given this context, here’s a revised approach to troubleshooting and some specific recommendations:

1.  **Configuration Validation:** The most likely culprit is an issue with the JSON pipeline configuration files themselves. Double-check that each file adheres *exactly* to the expected schema.  Use a JSON schema validator to ensure correctness.  It’s crucial that the inputs, outputs, and executor definitions are valid.

2.  **Logging & Debugging:**  Ensure your piper` CLI has robust logging.  You need to be able to see *exactly* what it’s doing, what errors it’s encountering, and the values of variables at each   stagA verbose logging to the `piper CLI to capture this information.

3.  Executor Errors: Since the executors are JavaScript/TypeScript modules or shell commands, investigate those closely.

       JS/TS Modules:  Check for errors in the code itself – incorrect imports, runtime errors, etc.
    *   **Shell Commands:** Verify that the commands are executable and that the necessary environment variables are set.

4.  **Schema Enforcement:**  Because the pipelines enforce schemas, there must be some mechanism that’s failing. Perhaps the schemas are overly strict, or the data being passed to the executors doesn't meet the required criteria. Debug the schema validation part of the piper system to see where it’s failing.

5. **Start Simple**: Can you get a very* basic pipeline (perhaps just one simple step) to run successfully before tackling the more complex ones? This will help isolate the problem.

Here's a table summarizing the next steps:

| Task                         | Description                               | Priority |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Validate JSON Pipeline Config | Use a JSON schema validator.              | High     |
| Add Verbose Logging          | In `piper` CLI – capture all outputs.       | High     |
| Simple Pipeline Test        | Create a minimal pipeline to run.         | Medium   |
| Debug Schema Validation     | Find the error in the schema validation. | Medium   |
To help me narrow things down, could you tell me:

*   Can you share an example of a pipeline JSON configuration file? (You can redact any sensitive information.)
*   What kind of error messages are you seeing when you run piper`? (Please provide the full error message.)
*   What programming language is the pipeline configuration file written in? (e.g., JSON, YAML, etc.)
