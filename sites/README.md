# Sites

This directory collects all frontend code for Promethean. Each subfolder contains a standalone HTML/JS frontend served by various services.

Current frontends:

- `smartgpt-dashboard` – OpenAPI-driven dashboard for SmartGPT Bridge.
- `llm-chat` – Minimal chat interface for the LLM service.
- `markdown-graph` – Force-directed visualization of markdown link graphs.

Future agents should place any web UI or dashboard code here.
