### Problem Statement
What are you trying to achieve? What's the rationale? Motivation?

### Solution Proposal
* What would a good solution look like? Key data structures, algorithms, or aPII?* If applicable, give a snippet TS api (type defs, pure functions, immutability):

### Scope
Which hardens does this unblock? What do we create/hange? (web components, Ava tests, release scripts)?

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UX: defined end-to-end, delimited scope
- [ ] UI: Web Components, [FP] Style
- [ ] TE:2019+ Native ESM, flat packages, GPC
### Checklists (maintainable & executable)
- [] Design aPI sketch
+ [ ] Sainty checks (types narrowing, immutability)
+ [ ] AVA tests added
+ [ ] Wiring docs: REAFME examples, usage
+ [ ] Prototype and release scripts
