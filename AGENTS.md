### Notes
 It is a large repo, and bash command commands are always ran from the package root
`cd` bash commands are *always* ran from the package root.
- put temporary scripts in a `pseudo/` folder, retain them so the steps you take can be validated
  - psuedo is never to be referenced inside of a package
  - pseudo is pseudocode, I don't know if it works, but it communciated an intent
- put markdown files in `docs/`
- you are in a repository where file changes automaticly trigger a commit to be made with a message generated by an llm
  - you don't need to commit your work
  - you don't need to make backups
- documentation should be obsidian friendly markdown
  - use [[wikilinks]]
  - make use of dataviews https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/
  - Update the [[HOME]] file with important information, treat it as a living document
