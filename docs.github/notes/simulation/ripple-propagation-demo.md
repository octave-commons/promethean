Ripple propagation demo for feedback from daemon execution back into the Eidolon field. Outline the event cascade and expected deformations per axis, then measure downstream node binding changes.

Sections:
- Event: daemon executes bound behavior
- Field update: local tension delta and gradient flux
- Propagation: attenuation/per-axis coupling (κ terms)
- Observation: node activation rate, binding radius changes
