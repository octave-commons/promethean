• Review Findings

  - High – pipelines.json:470 sonar-scan lists .cache/sonar/scan.touch as an output but the shell command is only sonar-scanner, so nothing ever creates
    that marker file and the step will fail its post-condition. Notice how the package-local definition (packages/sonarflow/pipeline.json:4) appends &&
    touch .cache/sonar/scan.touch; the top-level copy needs the same touch.
  - High – pipelines.json:650-729 Every test-gap step shells out with hard-coded /home/err/devel/promethean/... absolute paths. That bakes in one developer
    checkout path, so the pipeline breaks the moment it runs on any other machine or in CI. Please switch these arguments to repo-relative paths (the packa
    version in packages/testgap/pipelines.json shows the intended form).
  - Medium – pipelines.json:861 eslint-report redirects ESLint output into .cache/eslint/report.json but never ensures the directory exists. On a clean clo
    that causes bash: .cache/eslint/report.json: No such file or directory before ESLint even runs. Add a mkdir -p .cache/eslint (or equivalent) so the fir
    run succeeds.

  Let me know if you’d like me to help draft the fixes or add regression tests once the adjustments land.



• I'm getting ready to draft a concise final message that highlights the new task files added under
  docs/agile/tasks/ with their line references, clarifies that no tests were run since these are only
  tasks, and suggests running pnpm kanban regenerate as the next step. I'll organize this info clearly
  with bullet points to keep it well-structured and easy to read.

• Added three Kanban task specs detailing fixes for the pipelines issues and captured suggested
  pseudocode for each (docs/agile/tasks/fix-sonar-pipeline-missing-touch.md:1, docs/agile/tasks/remove-
  hardcoded-paths-from-test-gap-pipeline.md:1, docs/agile/tasks/ensure-eslint-pipeline-creates-cache-
  dir.md:1). Logged the additions in changelog.d/2025.10.07.01.01.34.md:1 to keep the change audit-
  friendly.

  Tests

  - Not run (task authoring only).
