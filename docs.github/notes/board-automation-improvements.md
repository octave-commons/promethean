1. Doing lanes, sure. Prompt Refinement, Agent Thinking, Breakdown, are all doing in the sense that I am working on writing them and planning. But there is no code happening for them (ideally, with the AI in the mix and how fast I can work now, some of this may have gotten done)
2. WIP per lane is set by the `# Title (n)`
3. Yea that is probably a good idea to make me do that.
4. Right now any column that is empty seems to be forgotten by the automation scripts. It would be cool for them to be able to refer to my process doc, or some other markdown file as a reference for what the board should look like
5. Why this one? Honestly the boards kinda... we need to look at it right now. I don't want to say rerrstart it but... a lot of what is in incoming should probably be in the ice box. That task, and several like it, were auto generated, and got pulled in by the automation script I was writing. 


Automation of the board needs some serious work. A lot of these automaticly generated tasks were sort of hidden from me til I fixed the scripts enough for them to not totally ruin the board.
