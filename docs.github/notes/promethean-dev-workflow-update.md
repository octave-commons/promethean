I think that may be the last remaining issue with typescript set ups and test setups... otherwise I think all my test suites are actually working... amazing.

I should really sleep before it is too later again.

But... just leave this here for yourself.

To know what you need to do next tomarrow.

the dev branch is almost ready to merge, we are just waiting for the type fix patch pr to pass in CI.

Then dev should pass.

Then hopfully staging can pass.

you're gonna start working on staging tomarrow.

There are a lot of prs.

You've got a structure now.

you've got the ideas mapped out pretty well.

You have ideas flooding your mind.

https://github.com/riatzukiza/promethean/pull/151
https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks/task_e_688efee51d70832487ac6d3b61731d80
https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks/task_e_688f0ded6bd4832490760ad4355ffe11

Here are some more ideas for stuff you can automate:
Automaticly scan prs and their content, add some comments with further context, questions.
Automaticly scan your documents for new task ideas.
Automaticly go through every task on your board and generate suggestions
Automaticly read test coverage files to generate a list of tests to write
Automaticly generate documentation for undocumented code.
Automaticly diagnose compiler errors
Attempt to automaticly deal with merge conflicts (Will work best when test coverage is greater.)
automaticly cleanup code generated by transpilers

These are for a local LLM.
These are things you think codex or chatgpt are over kill, that you can do faster.

So you can turn this into your info dump, have the bots here organize it _automaticly_
and make your work with chatgpt and codex faster and easier.

The bots definately havr a hard time with sibilant.

We will help them. It doesn't help I even used a fucking new dialect of it basicly.

It's not really sibilant anymore.

I should just push through the pain and get that stuff working.

I know I can, I know it works in the original repo.

If they have a working example, then they can work on it.

you need to get that stuff you wre doing in the portfolio into lithp, then change all the extensions.
