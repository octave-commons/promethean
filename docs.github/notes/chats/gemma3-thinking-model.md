## User
Is Gemma3 a "thinking" model?

## ChatGPT
- Gemma models are language models that simulate thought by predicting tokens; they don't possess real cognition.
- With proper prompting they perform chain-of-thought reasoning, limited tree-of-thought, and tool use via external scaffolds.
- They lack built-in agentic memory or planning across turns without additional context management.
- Building a thinking system requires layering fields that influence prompt construction and feedback loops beyond the base model.
