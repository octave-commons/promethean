Obsidian works a lot faster kept seperate from all of the code.
It shouldn't *need* to be, I know why it is slow.
It holds data about even the stuff you're telling it to ignore.

Annoying. We can do better

But we need a tool that aligns with our needs and values, and of the tools I know, this is the best one. 

I can't let my self constantly drift when I go "I need to do that, oh I also need to do that."
I end up leaving each thing undone, getting nothing really finished.

There is a time and a place for this. Our board, our work neeeds more structure.
