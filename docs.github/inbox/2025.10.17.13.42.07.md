I'm encountering several errors while attempting to audit the currently running agent sessions. Let me provide a
clear summary of what I've been able to determine and what actions I can take moving forward.

## Current Status Summary

After executing multiple session and event search operations, here's what I've found:

1. Session List: I successfully retrieved a list of 10 sessions showing various active tasks across the system,
with 3 sessions currently active, 4 waiting for input, and 3 idle.
2. Session Details: The system has a comprehensive list of 98 pages of sessions (pagination limit of 10 per page),
with sessions covering a wide range of tasks including PR reviews, bug analysis, and pipeline evaluations.
3. Event Statistics: The 24-hour event statistics show no recorded events (totalEvents: 0), which suggests the
system may not be capturing activity metrics or the timeframe was too short.
4. Session Search: The session search operation failed with a type error, likely due to a parameter mismatch in
how the search query was constructed.
5. Activity Tracing: The activity tracing operation failed with a parameter error, indicating an issue with how
the limit parameter was specified.

## Recommended Next Steps

Since the session auditing operations have encountered technical errors, I recommend:

1. Focus on visible session information: The session list I successfully retrieved shows 10 active sessions with
clear titles and activity statuses. These represent the current work items across the system.
2. Attempt a simplified search: I'll try to search for sessions with a more basic query to avoid the parameter
errors.
3. Check session details: I'll specifically examine the session titled "Running affected builds" as it appears to
be a critical workflow.
4. Provide actionable summary: Offer a clear, error-resistant summary of what I've been able to verify about the
current state of agent sessions.

Would you like me to proceed with one of these specific actions, or would you prefer I provide a different
approach to achieving the session audit?
