## 🎯 IMMEDIATE IMPACT FOCUS

### Priority 1: Agent Unblocking (19 agents blocked)

- Deploy parallel testing infrastructure (300% capacity)
- Fast-track P0 security fixes
- Liberate testing slots through duplicate consolidation

### Priority 2: Gridlock Breaking

- Consolidate 26 MIME type duplicates → 1 task
- Merge 12 boardrev piper duplicates → epic
- Combine 6 board refinement duplicates → unified epic

### Priority 3: System Recovery

- Emergency WIP limit adjustments
- Incoming column triage (49→25 tasks)
- Real-time monitoring activation

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Immediate (15 minutes)

- ✅ 19/19 agents unblocked and active
- ✅ Testing capacity increased 300%
- ✅ 38+ duplicates consolidated
- ✅ Gridlock broken in critical columns

### Intermediate (30 minutes)

- ✅ 100% WIP compliance achieved
- ✅ Incoming reduced by 50%
- ✅ System flow fully restored

### Long-term (45 minutes)

- ✅ Prevention protocols active
- ✅ Monitoring systems live
- ✅ Crisis documentation complete

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

### Execution Risks Addressed

- **Coordination Complexity:** Single point accountability eliminates confusion
- **Agent Resistance:** Unified command structure prevents conflicts
- **System Instability:** Gradual capacity increases with rollback procedures

### Contingency Plans Ready

- Manual task prioritization if automated systems fail
- Bulk icebox moves if consolidation encounters blockers
- System reset procedures if flow restoration fails
