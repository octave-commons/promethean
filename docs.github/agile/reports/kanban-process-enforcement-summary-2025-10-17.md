**Tasks Corrected:**
1. **Path Traversal Vulnerability Fix** (UUID: 3c6a52c7)
   - Moved from: `in_progress` ❌ → `todo` ✅
   - Justification: No actual implementation work completed
   - Status: Ready for real implementation work

2. **Input Validation Integration** (UUID: f44bbb50)
   - Moved from: `in_progress` ❌ → `todo` ✅
   - Justification: Framework exists but not integrated
   - Status: Ready for integration work

### ✅ Action 2: Administrative Task Completion
**Issue:** Completed breakdown work stuck in implementation column

**Task Corrected:**
1. **P0 Security Breakdown Coordination** (UUID: b6c5f483)
   - Moved from: `in_progress` ❌ → `done` ✅
   - Justification: Breakdown work fully completed
   - Status: Administrative capacity freed

### ✅ Action 3: Design Work Repositioning
**Issue:** Design work incorrectly classified as implementation

**Task Corrected:**
1. **Agent OS Protocol Design** (UUID: 0c3189e4)
   - Moved from: `in_progress` ❌ → `breakdown` ✅
   - Justification: Design work belongs in breakdown phase
   - Status: Properly categorized
