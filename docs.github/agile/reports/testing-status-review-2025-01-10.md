# Testing Status Review — 2025-01-10

We reviewed every task that was still marked `testing` in the kanban set and aligned each record with its actual state. None of the tasks had current validation evidence; most were either unstarted slices or placeholder templates. Status updates were applied directly in the task frontmatter and the table below captures the rationale for each change.

| Task | Updated Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
