# Kanban System Health Monitoring & Alerting Framework

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Monitor WIP limit violations across all columns
- [ ] Detect stuck tasks (time in column > threshold)
- [ ] Alert on board flow anomalies and bottlenecks
- [ ] Track task aging and priority drift
- [ ] Generate daily/weekly health reports
- [ ] Integrate with MCP for automated healing actions
- [ ] Create dashboard for real-time monitoring

## Implementation Details
1. **Metrics Collection**: Track task movements, dwell times, WIP violations
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement statistical analysis for flow issues
3. **Alerting System**: Create configurable alerts (email, Slack, console)
4. **MCP Integration**: Connect to healing agents for automatic fixes
5. **Reporting Engine**: Generate health reports with insights
6. **Dashboard**: Web UI for real-time monitoring
7. **Configuration**: YAML/JSON config for thresholds and rules

## Dependencies
- Existing kanban board data structure
- MCP integration for healing actions
- Alerting infrastructure (email/Slack)

## Complexity Estimate: 8 (Fibonacci) - Requires splitting
- Metrics Collection: 2 days
- Anomaly Detection: 2 days
- Alerting System: 1.5 days
- MCP Integration: 1.5 days
- Dashboard & Reports: 1 day

**Note**: This task should be split into smaller pieces (≤5 complexity)

## Exit Criteria
System automatically detects and alerts on kanban flow issues with integration to healing agents.
