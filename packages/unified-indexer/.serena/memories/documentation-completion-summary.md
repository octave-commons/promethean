## Impact

The documentation suite provides:
- **Complete API coverage** for all public functions
- **Practical guidance** for developers at all skill levels
- **Performance optimization** strategies for production use
- **Troubleshooting resources** for common problems
- **Integration patterns** for system architecture

## Next Steps (Optional)

While documentation is complete, the codebase has identified issues that could be addressed:
- Replace mock implementations with actual functionality
- Fix linting warnings and type safety issues
- Improve test coverage
- Address performance bottlenecks

These are **not required** for the documentation task but represent opportunities for code improvement.

## Task Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requested documentation has been created with comprehensive coverage, practical examples, and developer-focused guidance. The documentation suite is ready for use and provides complete guidance for working with the unified-indexer package.
