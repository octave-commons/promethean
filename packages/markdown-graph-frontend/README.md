# Markdown Link Graph

`graph.html` renders the markdown link graph produced by the `markdown_graph` service. Start the `frontend-service` with `pnpm --filter @promethean/frontend-service dev` and open `http://localhost:4500/markdown-graph/graph.html` while the service is running to explore the connected documents in a force-directed view.
