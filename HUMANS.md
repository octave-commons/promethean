### The Reality Check

You're building something massive while being fundamentally "short-handed" even with AI assistance. This means:

- **Capacity is real** - You can only do so much in a day/week
- **Context switching is expensive** - Jumping between too many things kills momentum
- **AI helps but doesn't multiply you** - You're still the one making decisions and doing the thinking
- **Burnout is the enemy** - Sustainable pace beats heroic effort bursts every effort

### Chill Philosophy

- **The board serves YOU, not the other way around**
- **Work gets done, someefforts outside formal processes - and that's totally fine**
- **Retrospective card movement honors work completed** - No guilt, just acknowledgment
- **"Failed" processes are learning, not violations** - You're figuring this out as you go
- **We think better when we're calm** - Even urgent stuff deserves a breath
- **Good enough is often perfect** - Perfection is the enemy of shipped

### Realistic Capacity Management

**Daily Capacity:**

- 2-4 meaningful tasks represent great capacity utilization
- Some days you'll complete one focused objective or implement one feature
- Other days you'll complete major architectural improvements
- AI can help with implementation, but you still need to drive the strategic decisions

**Weekly Planning:**

- Select 1-2 major priorities for the week
- Let smaller stuff fill in the gaps
- Don't over-schedule - leave capacity for discovery and problem-solving
- If you're consistently not completing planned work, that's a signal to adjust planning, not increase effort

**Task Triage:**

- **Must do** - Things that block other work or are breaking
- **Should do** - Important features that move the needle
- **Could do** - Nice improvements when you have energy
- **Won't do** - Ideas that sounded good but don't fit current reality
