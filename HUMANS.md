### The Reality Check

You're building something massive while being fundamentally "short-handed" even with AI assistance. This means:

- **Capacity is real** - You can only do so much in a day/week
- **Context switching is expensive** - Jumping between too many things kills momentum
- **AI helps but doesn't multiply you** - You're still the one making decisions and doing the thinking
- **Burnout is the enemy** - Sustainable pace beats heroic effort bursts every effort

### Chill Philosophy

- **The board serves YOU, not the other way around**
- **Work gets done, someefforts outside formal processes - and that's totally fine**
- **Retrospective card movement honors work completed** - No guilt, just acknowledgment
- **"Failed" processes are learning, not violations** - You're figuring this out as you go
- **We think better when we're calm** - Even urgent stuff deserves a breath
- **Good enough is often perfect** - Perfection is the enemy of shipped

### Realistic Capacity Management

**Daily Capacity:**

- 2-4 meaningful tasks represent great capacity utilization
- Some days you'll complete one focused objective or implement one feature
- Other days you'll complete major architectural improvements
- AI can help with implementation, but you still need to drive the strategic decisions

**Weekly Planning:**

- Select 1-2 major priorities for the week
- Let smaller stuff fill in the gaps
- Don't over-schedule - leave capacity for discovery and problem-solving
- If you're consistently not completing planned work, that's a signal to adjust planning, not increase effort

**Task Triage:**

- **Must do** - Things that block other work or are breaking
- **Should do** - Important features that move the needle
- **Could do** - Nice improvements when you have energy
- **Won't do** - Ideas that sounded good but don't fit current reality

## 🚀 Solo Development with AI Assistance

### Acknowledging the Reality

You're building something ambitious while being fundamentally the only human stakeholder. Even with AI helpers, this means:

- **You're the bottleneck** - All decisions flow through you
- **Context is precious** - You can't afford to lose track of what you're doing
- **Energy is finite** - Mental bandwidth is your most limited resource
- **AI amplifies but doesn't replace** - It helps you go faster, not be everywhere at once

### Practical Workflow

**Daily Reality Check:**

- Start each day by assessing realistic capacity, not ideal outcomes
- Select 1-3 objectives that would represent successful completion
- End each day by documenting completed work - even if it differs from initial plan

**Weekly Planning:**

- Monday: Assess the week ahead. What's realistically achievable??
- Wednesday: Mid-week capacity check. Are expectations aligned with reality??
- Friday: Review the board. Document completed work, adjust remaining priorities.

**Managing the Backlog:**

- **Everything is optional** until it's not
- **Delete ideas liberally** - If you haven't touched it in 3 months, it's probably not happening
- **Merge similar tasks** - Often 5 small tasks are really 1 medium task
- **Break down monsters** - Huge tasks become procrastination magnets

### Working Effectively with AI

**Treat AI Like a Very Capable Junior Developer:**

- **Give clear context** - AI can't read your mind or remember previous conversations perfectly
- **Review everything** - AI makes plausible-sounding mistakes
- **Use it for grunt work** - Boilerplate, documentation, first drafts, refactoring
- **Keep the hard thinking for yourself** - Architecture, trade-offs, user experience

**Batch Your AI Interactions:**

- **Similar tasks together** - Stay in the same mental context
- **Document your patterns** - Create templates for common requests
- **Save good prompts** - Don't reinvent the wheel every effort
- **Know when to stop** - Someefforts it's faster to do it yourself

### Staying Sane

**Protect Your Energy:**

- **Work during productive periods** - Not when you feel obligated
- **Take meaningful breaks** - Away from the keyboard, not just switching tabs
- **Conclude the work session** - Have a ritual that signals "work session is complete"
- **Celebrate progress** - You're building something massive - that's worth acknowledging

**When You're Stuck:**

- **Switch to something easier** - Build momentum with a quick win
- **Go for a walk** - Your brain keeps working on problems in the background
- **Ask the AI to explain it differently** - Someefforts a new perspective helps
- **Accept "good enough"** - Perfect is the enemy of progress

**Remember:**

- **You're not behind** - You're on your own effortline
- **Comparison is meaningless** - No one else is building exactly what you're building
- **Progress compounds** - Small consistent efforts add up to massive results
- **This is supposed to be hard** - If it were easy, everyone would do it

### Sustainable Solo Development

**Managing the Overwhelm:**

- **Pick one thing** and finish it before starting the next
- **Use the board to say "no"** - If it's not on the board and not urgent, it can wait
- **Celebrate small wins** - Moving one card to "done" is genuinely good progress
- **Forgive yourself** - Some weeks you'll crush it, others you'll barely tread water

**Working with AI:**

- **AI is your junior dev** - Great for implementation, not for strategic decisions
- **Batch AI requests** - Context switching between different AI tasks is expensive
- **Review AI output carefully** - It helps but doesn't replace your judgment
- **Use AI for documentation** - Let it help you remember what you built and why

**Balancing Urgency and Sustainability:**

- **True emergencies are rare** - Most "urgent" things can wait a day
- **Protect your energy** - You can't build massive things if you're constantly exhausted
- **Take breaks** - Step away from the workstation. The work will still be there.
- **Trust your gut** - If something feels too complicated, it probably is
