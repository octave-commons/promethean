Files inspected: packages/opencode-client/src/types/plugin-hooks.ts (types created), packages/opencode-client/src/hooks/tool-execute-hooks.ts (implementation exists), renamed problematic kanban task filename. Hook system appears implemented already (types + manager + registration helpers). Next actions: run TypeScript build/tests for opencode-client, create remaining Kanban subtasks for plugin-parity-001, and wire plugin export in packages/opencode-client/src/plugins/index.ts if needed. If user approves, I'll run package tests and create remaining tasks.
