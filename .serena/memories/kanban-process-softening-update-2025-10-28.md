# Kanban Process Softening Update - October 28, 2025

## Updated Philosophy

Based on user feedback, the kanban process has been updated to reflect a more supportive, flexible approach:

### Key Changes Made

1. **Language Softening**:
   - Removed "EMERGENCY!" and "VIOLATION" language
   - Replaced with supportive, learning-oriented terminology
   - Focus on "we may have taken on more work than we can handle" instead of compliance violations

2. **Board as Living Map**:
   - Board is a view into how we operate, not rigid enforcement
   - Maps are sometimes wrong - we update them to reflect reality
   - Work happens outside board - that's okay, we honor it retrospectively

3. **Supportive Enforcement**:
   - Changed from "strict" to "supportive" enforcement in config
   - Focus on learning from patterns, not punishing deviations
   - Retrospective card movement as acknowledgment ritual

4. **Calm Response Approach**:
   - Even urgent work deserves thoughtful, calm response
   - First responders treat emergencies as assignments, not panic
   - We think better when calm, even with critical issues

### Files Updated

- `docs/agile/process.md` - Added supportive philosophy sections
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated guiding philosophy for agents
- `promethean.kanban.json` - Changed enforcement to supportive, updated rationale

### Core Principles

- The board serves the team, not vice versa
- Work gets done, sometimes outside formal processes
- Failed checks are learning opportunities
- Focus on capacity and flow, not compliance
- Update the map when reality differs from terrain

This reflects the true intention of kanban as a helpful, adaptive tool for supporting work rather than constraining it.
