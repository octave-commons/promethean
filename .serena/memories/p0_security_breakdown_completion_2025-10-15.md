**Completed By**: SubAgent-l3wgdl (Task Architect)  
**Completion Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Duration**: 2 hours

## Analysis Summary

### P0 Security Tasks Identified
1. **Critical Path Traversal Vulnerability (3c6a52c7)** - ACTIVE EXPLOIT
2. **Input Validation Integration (f44bbb50)** - PROCESS VIOLATION
3. **MCP Security Hardening (d794213f)** - COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY NEEDED

### Key Findings
- **CRITICAL**: Active path traversal vulnerability in indexer-service
- **HIGH**: Security framework exists but not integrated (process violation)
- **HIGH**: Multiple MCP attack vectors without protection

### Deliverables Created
1. P0-Security-Task-Breakdown-Analysis.md - Comprehensive analysis
2. P0-Path-Traversal-Fix-Subtasks.md - Critical vulnerability subtasks (5 subtasks, 4 hours)
3. P0-Input-Validation-Integration-Subtasks.md - Framework integration subtasks (5 subtasks, 10 hours)
4. P0-MCP-Security-Hardening-Subtasks.md - Comprehensive security subtasks (7 subtasks, 16 hours)
5. P0-Security-Implementation-Roadmap.md - Coordination and deployment plan

### Implementation Plan
- **Total Time**: 30 hours
- **Phase 1** (0-4 hours): Critical vulnerability fix
- **Phase 2** (4-14 hours): Framework integration
