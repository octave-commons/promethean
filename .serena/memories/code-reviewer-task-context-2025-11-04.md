Preparing to invoke the code-reviewer agent for the Promethean workspace. No commits exist yet on main. Gathered TypeScript review references (unused locals, unreachable code, compiler diagnostics). Located external best practices resources (Microsoft JS/TS code review checklist, Medium frontend review article, DEV TypeScript best practices). To craft the agent prompt, highlight that no specific code diff is available and request general review guidance aligned with these resources.
