# Kanban Process Correction - No Time Estimates

## Critical Process Update Required

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Issue**: Referenced time estimates, sprints, and time-based planning in kanban audit
**Correction Required**: Remove ALL time-based references from process documentation

## Changes Made

### docs/agile/process.md
1. **Section 3**: "Breakdown & Estimate" → "Breakdown & Size"
2. **Assessment criteria**: "complexity, scale, time (in cloud sessions)" → "complexity, scope, and Level of Effort (LoE)"
3. **Ready Gate**: "fits session after planning" → "fits capacity after planning"
4. **Session-end handoff**: "Time/compute limit reached" → "Capacity limit reached"

### AGENTS.md
1. **Daily Reality** → **Daily Capacity**
2. **Weekly Rhythm** → **Weekly Planning**
3. **Task completion**: "2-4 meaningful tasks is a great day" → "2-4 meaningful tasks represent great capacity utilization"
4. **Work descriptions**: Focus on completion and capacity rather than time
5. **Planning guidance**: "realistic" vs "ideal" → "realistic capacity" vs "ideal outcomes"
6. **Break guidance**: "real breaks" → "meaningful breaks"
7. **Session management**: "End the day" → "Conclude the work session"
8. **Sustainability**: "heroic time-based planning" → "heroic effort bursts"
9. **All references to "time"** → "effort" (where appropriate)

## Core Principle

**NO TIME-BASED PLANNING - EVER**
- Use story points, complexity, LoE (Level of Effort)
- Use capacity-based planning, not time-based
- Focus on sustainable effort, not heroic sprints
- Assess complexity and scope, not duration

## Future Prevention

1. **Audit all documentation** for time-based language
2. **Update templates** to use effort-based terminology
3. **Train AI agents** on corrected process language
4. **Review kanban rules** for time references
5. **Update task creation guidelines** to exclude time estimates

## Impact

This correction aligns documentation with actual project philosophy:
- Solo development with variable capacity
- Complexity-based sizing, not time-based estimation
- Sustainable effort over heroic bursts
- Capacity management over time management

All future process documentation must use effort-based language exclusively.
