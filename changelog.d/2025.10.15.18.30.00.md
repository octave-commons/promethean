# Security Assessment: Kanban CLI Validation

## Security Analysis Completed

Comprehensive security assessment of the `validateStartingStatus` function and related kanban CLI validation logic.

### Security Findings

**Critical Issues:**

- No authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Unicode normalization bypass vulnerability in columnKey() function
- Missing audit trail for security events

**High Priority Issues:**

- Insufficient input sanitization
- Information disclosure in error messages
- No rate limiting on task creation

**Medium Priority Issues:**

- Limited data validation beyond status field
- No compliance features (GDPR, privacy controls)
- Missing integrity verification mechanisms

### Recommendations Implemented

1. **Security Assessment Report**: Created comprehensive security analysis covering 7 domains
2. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach for security improvements
3. **Testing Framework**: Security testing suite recommendations
4. **Threat Modeling**: Attack surface analysis and mitigation strategies

### Files Modified/Created

- `SECURITY_ASSESSMENT_KANBAN_VALIDATION.md` - Complete security assessment report
- `changelog.d/2025.10.15.18.30.00.md` - This changelog entry

### Next Steps

- Phase 1 (Week 1): Implement authentication and fix critical vulnerabilities
- Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Security hardening and authorization
- Phase 3 (Week 4+): Compliance and monitoring features

### Security Impact

This assessment identifies critical security gaps in the kanban CLI validation system and provides a clear roadmap for implementing comprehensive security controls. Immediate attention is required for authentication and input validation vulnerabilities.
