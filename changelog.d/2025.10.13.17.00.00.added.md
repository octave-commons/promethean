# Added: Automated Code Review Rule for Kanban Transitions

- **Feature**: New transition rule for `review → document` that runs automated code review workflow
- **Integration**: Uses `@promethean/agents-workflow` package for code review automation
- **Context Gathering**: Implements nearest neighbor search and git diff analysis
- **Validation**: Only allows transition after successful code review completion
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive task breakdown with acceptance criteria and implementation plan

## Impact
Enhances the Promethean Framework's kanban system with intelligent automation while maintaining the existing transition rules architecture and agent-driven cognitive design principles.
