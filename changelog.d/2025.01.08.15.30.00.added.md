# Added: Complete Omni Protocol Implementation

- Added comprehensive RequestContext interface with subject, capabilities, and audit fields
- Implemented complete method family interfaces for files, search, sinks, indexer, agents, exec, github, and metadata operations
- Added success/error envelope types matching SmartGPT bridge patterns with { ok, base, entries } structure
- Implemented stream event definitions with { event, data, ts, seq } shape for agent logs, status updates, and system events
- Extended Zod validation schemas to cover all new types
- Created comprehensive unit tests for envelope validation, stream events, and request context
- Added JSON Schema emitter placeholders for adapter generation
- Split test files to maintain code organization and stay within line limits

The implementation closely follows the Omni Protocol Specification v0 Draft, maintaining compatibility with SmartGPT bridge response patterns while adding the structured interfaces needed for multi-transport adapters.
