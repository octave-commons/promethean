Dev UI improvements:

- Collapsible pipelines in the Piper UI with per-pipeline persisted state (localStorage).
- Collapsible step panels for each `<piper-step>` including toggle caret; collapse hides fields/log to shorten long lists.
- Hot-reload state preserves collapsed/expanded state across updates.
