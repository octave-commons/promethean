# Implement Separate Test Coverage Pipelines

Created comprehensive task for implementing separate test coverage pipelines for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Changes

- Added task: `docs/agile/tasks/implement-separate-test-coverage-pipelines.md`
- Task includes detailed implementation plan with 3 phases
- Covers test classification, pipeline configuration, and CI/CD integration
- Follows repository conventions and TDD approach
- Includes migration strategy for existing tests
- Provides timeline estimate and acceptance criteria

## Impact

- Will provide visibility into test coverage quality across different testing levels
- Enables targeted improvements for specific test types
- Supports better metrics for code quality assessment
- Maintains compatibility with existing tooling (AVA, Nx, pnpm)
