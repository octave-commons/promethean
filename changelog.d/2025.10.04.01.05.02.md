- Fix: Expand $HOME and ~ when generating MCP server configs so Emacs and other clients receive absolute exec paths. Applied to elisp, mcp.json, vscode.json, and codex.toml writers.
- Restore tree-sitter-backed Elisp adapter: locate the auto-generated block via AST, preserve surrounding forms, and rewrite the hub servers in place.
- Root cause: writers preserved EDN strings verbatim; no env expansion; elisp adapter had regressed to string parsing after tree-sitter migration.
