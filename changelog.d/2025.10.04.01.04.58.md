- Fix: Expand $HOME and ~ when generating MCP server configs so Emacs and other clients receive absolute exec paths. Applied to elisp, mcp.json, vscode.json, and codex.toml writers.
- Root cause: writers preserved EDN strings verbatim; no env expansion; elisp adapter uses a lightweight parser, not tree-sitter.
