# Process Update: Added Testing Step After Review

## Date
2025.06.20.15.30.00

## Changes
Updated the agile process documentation to include a dedicated testing step after review:

### Modified Workflow
- **Step 6**: Changed from "Test → Review → Document" to "Review → Test → Document"
- **Flow**: In Progress → In Review → Testing → Document → Done

### Updated FSM Transitions
- Added `In Review → Testing` transition for approved reviews
- Added `Testing → Document` transition for completed testing
- Added `Testing → In Review` transition for testing failures requiring review adjustments
- Added `In Review → Breakdown` transition for scope changes

### Rationale
This change ensures that code review feedback is addressed before dedicated testing begins, providing a cleaner separation between review feedback cycles and testing validation. The new flow allows for more focused testing of reviewed and approved changes.

## Impact
- Tasks now flow through Review before entering Testing phase
- Testing failures can return to Review for clarification
- Maintains all existing cycle-back paths and WIP constraints
- Preserves session-end handoff mechanisms
