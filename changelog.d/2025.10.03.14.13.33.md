- Ensure MCP stdio proxies inherit the current process environment so tools like `npx` are available without redefining `PATH` in configs.
- Resolve stdio command lookup issues by normalizing tool paths without breaking npm-based MCP servers (e.g. ESLint, ts-ls-lsp), and cover the new path resolution in tests.
