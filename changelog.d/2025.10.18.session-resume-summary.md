# Session Resume Summary - 2025.10.18

## Current State Overview

Successfully resumed work and completed the **Fix Kanban Column Underscore Normalization Bug** task that was in progress.

## Completed Work

### ✅ Fixed Kanban Column Underscore Normalization Bug

- **Task ID**: 02c78938-cf9c-45a0-b5ff-6e7a212fb043
- **Status**: Moved from `in_progress` → `done`
- **Priority**: P0 → P1 (downgraded since bug fix is complete)

**Issue Resolved**:

- Board's `columnKey()` function and transition rules' `normalizeColumnName()` method were producing different results
- Both now consistently convert spaces and hyphens to underscores
- Test case confirms all column name variations now match perfectly

**Verification**:

- Ran test suite: `packages/kanban/dist/tests/underscore-bug-demo.test.js`
- All test cases pass with ✅ match status
- No more inconsistencies between CLI commands and transition rules

## Current Kanban Board Status

- **Total Tasks**: 485
- **In Progress**: 16/50 (32%)
- **Recent Completion**: 1 task moved to done

## Key Areas of Active Work

### High Priority P0 Tasks In Progress:

1. **Data Collection Interfaces** (3 duplicate tasks - needs cleanup)
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Layer**
3. **Cross-Platform Build Configuration**
4. **P0 Security Task Breakdown**
5. **Agent OS Core Message Protocol**
6. **Automated Compliance Monitoring System**
7. **Security Task Validation Gates**
8. **WIP Limit Enforcement Gate**

### P1 Tasks In Progress:

1. **Scar Context Builder**
2. **LLM Integration for Context Enhancement**
3. **Git Workflow Core Implementation**

## System Health

### ✅ Working Correctly:

- Kanban board regeneration and sync
- Task status transitions (following proper workflow)
- Audit system with automatic fixes
- Column normalization consistency

### ⚠️ Issues Identified:

- Multiple duplicate tasks for "Define Data Collection Interfaces"
- Some P0 security tasks blocked by validation requirements
- Orphaned events in audit log (15 tasks with events but not in board)

## Recent Infrastructure Improvements

Based on changelog analysis, recent work includes:

1. **GitHub Actions Timeouts** - Added job-level timeouts to all 9 workflows
2. **Dualstore-HTTP Integration** - Successfully integrated with fixed field mapping
3. **Security Hardening** - Multiple P0 security validation tasks in progress

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Cleanup Duplicate Tasks**: Address the 3 duplicate "Define Data Collection Interfaces" tasks
2. **P0 Security Focus**: Continue work on security validation and monitoring systems
3. **Cross-Platform Development**: Progress on compatibility layer and build configuration
4. **Board Maintenance**: Consider running audit cleanup for orphaned events

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check current status
pnpm kanban count
pnpm kanban list --status in_progress

# Address duplicates
pnpm kanban search "Define Data Collection Interfaces"

# Continue P0 security work
pnpm kanban list --priority P0 --status in_progress

# Board maintenance
pnpm kanban audit --fix
```

The system is in good working order with the underscore normalization bug completely resolved and proper workflow validation in place.
