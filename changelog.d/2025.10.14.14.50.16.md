# ClojureScript Frontend Package Reorganization

## Changes

- Created `@promethean/mcp-dev-ui-frontend` package and moved ClojureScript code from `packages/mcp/dev-ui/`
- Updated existing `@promethean/report-forge-frontend` package in `packages/frontends/` with improved ClojureScript render implementation
- Removed ClojureScript code from original packages (`packages/mcp/dev-ui/`, `packages/report-forge/src/lib/render.cljs`)
- Updated root `package.json` to include `@promethean/mcp-dev-ui-frontend` dependency
- Updated `shadow-cljs.edn` with new source paths and build targets for mcp-dev-ui-frontend
- Verified that kanban package has no ClojureScript code to migrate

## Impact

- Frontend ClojureScript code is now properly organized in dedicated frontend packages
- Backend packages remain focused on their core functionality
- Build configuration updated to support the new package structure
- Maintains consistency with the overall frontend package organization strategy
- ClojureScript frontend packages: `@promethean/mcp-dev-ui-frontend` (new) and `@promethean/report-forge-frontend` (updated)
