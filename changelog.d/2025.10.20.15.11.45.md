# Build Fixes for @promethean/kanban

## Fixed Issues in rules-engine.ts

### Syntax Errors

- Fixed missing closing braces in try-catch blocks around line 191-197
- Fixed missing closing brace for TypeScript analysis for loop around line 621
- Fixed missing closing braces for security analysis nested loops around line 636

### Type Safety Issues

- Removed unused imports: `access`, `stat`, `path`
- Fixed unused parameters by prefixing with underscore
- Fixed possibly undefined objects with proper null checks
- Fixed security analyzer to handle array of SecurityResult correctly
- Made `getDefaultConfig()` public to allow external access

### Cache Validation Fix

- Fixed async cache validation logic to properly handle promises
- Added proper async/await pattern for cache validity checks

### Other Improvements

- Fixed parameter destructuring to avoid unused variable warnings
- Improved error handling in code review methods

## Status

The main `rules-engine.ts` file now compiles without errors. There are remaining issues in other files (test files, heal modules, etc.) that were not part of the original request but are documented in the build output.
