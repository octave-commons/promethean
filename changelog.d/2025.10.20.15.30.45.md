# OpenCode Client Indexer Service Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete indexer service for the `@promethean/opencode-client` package that actively captures and indexes OpenCode events, sessions, and messages to a dual store (MongoDB + Chroma).

## What was implemented:

### 1. Fixed Core Client Issues

- ✅ Fixed client initialization to use direct `createOpencodeClient({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4096' })`
- ✅ Corrected API usage for sessions, messages, and events
- ✅ Fixed response handling with proper `result.data` access
- ✅ All commands now successfully connect to OpenCode server

### 2. Implemented IndexerService (`src/services/indexer.ts`)

- ✅ Active event subscription via `client.event.subscribe()`
- ✅ Real-time indexing of events as markdown documents
- ✅ Indexing of existing sessions and messages
- ✅ Proper dual store integration using `insert()` method
- ✅ Markdown document generation for all data types
- ✅ Error handling and graceful shutdown

### 3. Created CLI Commands

- ✅ `indexer start` - Starts active indexing service
- ✅ `indexer stop` - Stops indexing service
- ✅ `indexer status` - Checks service status
- ✅ All commands integrated into main CLI

### 4. Verified Functionality

- ✅ Successfully connects to OpenCode server on port 4096
- ✅ Captures live events: server.connected, message.part.updated, message.updated, permission.replied
- ✅ Indexes existing sessions (3 sessions found)
- ✅ Stores data in dual store (MongoDB + Chroma)
- ✅ All CLI commands working properly

## Current State:

- **Client**: Fully functional OpenCode server client
- **Indexer**: Actively capturing and indexing live data
- **Storage**: Dual store with proper markdown document indexing
- **CLI**: Complete command interface for management

## Files Modified/Created:

- `src/services/indexer.ts` - Core indexer service
- `src/commands/indexer/` - CLI commands for indexer management
- `src/cli.ts` - Added indexer command group
- Fixed all existing command files for proper API usage

## Testing Results:

- ✅ Session creation: `ses_5fc44ed82ffe9Pc4fxjpBxpUoX`
- ✅ Message sending and listing working
- ✅ Event subscription working with proper event handling
- ✅ Indexer successfully capturing live events
- ✅ Data being stored and retrieved from dual store

The `@promethean/opencode-client` is now a complete, functional client for OpenCode servers with active indexing capabilities.
