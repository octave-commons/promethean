# Session Orchestrator Plugin Split

## Changed

- Renamed the `OpencodeInterfacePlugin` surface to **Session Orchestrator Plugin** and exposed two focused entry points: `SessionIndexingPlugin` (read-only context tooling) and `AgentOrchestrationPlugin` (session lifecycle + prompts).
- Refactored the plugin into shared modules (`src/shared`, `src/tools`) so `@promethean-os/opencode-client` re-exports the same implementation instead of maintaining a divergent copy.
- Updated documentation and examples to highlight the new naming, npm installation commands, and dev workflow for loading the plugin locally via `file://` paths in `opencode.json`.

## Added

- Builder-level tests that verify each toolset exposes the expected commands, preventing regressions as modules evolve.
