# Prevent invalid starting status creation in kanban CLI

## Summary

Completed P0 task to add validation that prevents creating tasks with invalid starting statuses in the kanban CLI.

## Changes Made

- Added `validateStartingStatus` function in `packages/kanban/src/lib/kanban.ts`
- Integrated validation into the `createTask` function to enforce valid starting statuses
- Only allows "icebox" and "incoming" as valid starting statuses for new tasks
- Provides clear error message when invalid status is specified

## Testing

- Verified that invalid statuses (e.g., "invalid_status") are properly blocked
- Confirmed that valid statuses ("icebox", "incoming") work correctly
- Ensured default behavior (no status specified) defaults to "incoming"

## Impact

- Prevents user errors when creating tasks with inappropriate starting statuses
- Maintains data integrity in the kanban system
- Provides clear feedback to users about valid options
