# MCP-Kanban Bridge API Implementation

## Added

- Created new MCP bridge API tools in `packages/mcp/src/tools/kanban-bridge.ts`
- Implemented 7 new bridge tools:
  - `kanban_subscribe_to_events` - Real-time event subscriptions
  - `kanban_get_event_history` - Historical event retrieval
  - `kanban_create_task` - Task creation with event generation
  - `kanban_bulk_update_tasks` - Bulk task operations
  - `kanban_get_board_schema` - Comprehensive MCP schema definitions
  - `kanban_realtime_sync` - Bidirectional real-time synchronization
  - `kanban_broadcast_event` - Event broadcasting to subscribers
- Registered all new tools in main MCP server (`packages/mcp/src/index.ts`)

## Technical Details

- All tools follow MCP ToolFactory pattern with proper Zod schemas
- Experimental stability flag with version 0.1.0
- Real-time capabilities designed for WebSocket/SSE infrastructure
- Comprehensive JSON schema definitions for Task, Board, and Event objects
- Proper error handling and TypeScript compliance

## Next Steps

- Implement real-time WebSocket/SSE server infrastructure
- Integrate EventLogManager for historical events
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Create integration tests for bidirectional synchronization
