# P0: Add Job-Level Timeouts to All Workflows

## Summary

Added job-level `timeout-minutes` to all 9 GitHub Actions workflows that were missing them, preventing pipeline reliability issues and hanging processes.

## Changes Made

### Workflows Updated with Timeouts:

1. **kanban-sync.yml** - 15 minutes (board regeneration and sync operations)
2. **docs-guard.yml** - 10 minutes (documentation validation checks)
3. **lockfile-heal.yml** - 20 minutes (dependency lockfile maintenance)
4. **branch-cleanup.yml** - 30 minutes (branch cleanup operations)
5. **opencode.yml** - 25 minutes (AI coding assistant operations)
6. **publish-play-clj-image.yml** - 60 minutes (Docker image build and publish)
7. **sync-kanban-to-github.yml** - 20 minutes (GitHub issues synchronization)
8. **codeql.yml** - 120 minutes (security analysis across multiple languages)
9. **lint-taskgen.yml** - 30 minutes (automated linting task generation)

### Timeout Rationale:

- **Lightweight operations** (docs-guard): 10 minutes
- **Standard operations** (kanban-sync, lockfile-heal, sync-kanban-to-github): 15-20 minutes
- **Complex operations** (branch-cleanup, lint-taskgen, opencode): 25-30 minutes
- **Heavy operations** (Docker builds): 60 minutes
- **Security analysis** (CodeQL): 120 minutes (comprehensive scanning)

## Impact

- ✅ Prevents hanging GitHub Actions workflows
- ✅ Improves pipeline reliability and predictability
- ✅ Reduces resource waste from stuck jobs
- ✅ Provides better feedback on workflow failures
- ✅ Aligns with GitHub Actions best practices

## Verification

All 21 workflow files now have job-level timeouts configured appropriately for their complexity and expected execution time.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - P0 critical infrastructure fix implemented
