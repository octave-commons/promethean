# Fixed TypeScript Compilation Errors in OpenCode Client

## Summary

Fixed the remaining TypeScript compilation errors in the `@promethean/opencode-client` package that were preventing successful builds.

## Changes Made

### Fixed Ollama Queue Integration

- **Issue**: `setProcessingInterval(null)` was being called but the function signature only accepts `NodeJS.Timeout`, not `null`
- **Solution**: Updated imports to use `clearProcessingInterval()` function instead of manually calling `clearInterval()` and `setProcessingInterval(null)`

### Files Modified

1. **`src/tools/ollama.ts`**:

   - Updated imports to include `clearProcessingInterval` and remove `setProcessingInterval`
   - Fixed `stopQueueProcessor()` function to use `clearProcessingInterval()`

2. **`src/actions/ollama/tools.ts`**:
   - Updated imports to include proper functions from ollama-queue
   - Fixed `startQueueProcessor()` and `stopQueueProcessor()` functions
   - Removed unused imports (`listModels`, `check`, `OllamaError`, `clearProcessingInterval`)
   - Removed unused `stopQueueProcessor()` function

### Technical Details

- The root cause was a mismatch between the function signature in `@promethean/ollama-queue` package and its usage in the client
- The ollama-queue package provides `clearProcessingInterval()` which properly handles setting the internal interval to `null`
- All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved

## Result

- ✅ Build now succeeds without errors
- ✅ All tools properly wrapped in plugins with client injection
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation warnings or errors
- ✅ Plugin wrapping work for opencode-client package is complete

## Impact

This completes the plugin wrapping work for the opencode-client package, ensuring all tools are properly encapsulated with client injection and the package builds successfully.
