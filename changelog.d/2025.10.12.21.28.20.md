## Fixed

- **kanban**: Fixed board regeneration to include columns for tasks with non-standard status values
- **kanban**: Modified `regenerateBoard` function to create columns for existing task statuses that aren't in the default configuration
- **kanban**: Resolved failing test "integration: board operations do not create duplicate files"

## Details

The `regenerateBoard` function was only creating columns for configured status values (`['open', 'doing', 'blocked', 'done', 'dropped']`), causing tasks with custom statuses like `'todo'`, `'ready'`, and `'in-progress'` to be lost during board regeneration. The fix ensures that all existing task statuses are represented as columns, while maintaining backward compatibility with configured columns.
