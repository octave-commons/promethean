Dev UI stability fixes:

- Removed global rate limiting from `@promethean-os/piper` dev server to prevent 429s on static assets and HMR requests.
- Disabled immediate SSE `frontend:update` on connect to avoid reload loops; updates now emit only on file changes.
- Fixed web component hot-reload by making `PiperStep` a plain impl class (no `extends HTMLElement`), resolving “Illegal constructor” errors with the HMR wrapper.
