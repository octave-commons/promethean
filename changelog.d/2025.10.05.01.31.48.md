- extend the HTTP transport to expose action routes and OpenAPI schemas for stdio proxies, deriving metadata through JSON-RPC and normalizing remote tool definitions
- clamp OpenAPI descriptions to 300 characters, surface consistent success payload schemas, and tighten validation for proxied tool inputs
- generate OpenAPI server URLs from requests or BASE_ACTION_URL to support reverse proxies, and update integration tests to cover the proxied action flows
