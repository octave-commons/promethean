- Allow MCP to load configs from absolute paths outside the package cwd and cover it with a regression test.
- Accept batched `initialize` requests for HTTP endpoints so connectors that send arrays succeed; add regression coverage.
- Expose MCP HTTP endpoints for `GET`/`DELETE` methods alongside `POST`, and answer CORS preflight `OPTIONS` requests so connectors can open SSE streams without 404s.
- Adopt canonical MCP EDN with HTTP metadata, refresh downstream configs (codex, VSCode, promethan.mcp.json) so both stdio proxies and HTTP endpoints stay in sync.
- Elisp adapter now emits HTTP `:url` entries alongside stdio commands, so `bb -m mk.mcp-cli push-all` keeps mcp.el aligned automatically.
