## Session Type

Strategic Task Management & WIP Optimization

## Summary

Resumed from previous duplicate cleanup session with focus on strategic task movement and WIP limit compliance. Successfully removed major duplicate clusters and prioritized critical P0 items.

## Actions Taken

### Major Duplicate Cleanup (22+ tasks removed)

**Agent OS Protocol Specifications Duplicates:**

- Removed 5 duplicates of "Design Agent OS Comprehensive Protocol Specifications" from blocked column
- Removed 1 duplicate of "Agent OS Comprehensive Review and Enhancement" from blocked column
- Kept primary tasks to maintain work continuity

**Build System Duplicates:**

- Removed 9 duplicates of "Fix DS package missing dependencies causing build failures" from ready column
- Removed 14 duplicates of "Fix eslint-tasks pipeline TypeScript parser configuration issues" from ready column
- Maintained primary instances for critical build system fixes

### Strategic Task Movement

**Priority P0 Task Advancement:**

- Moved "Infrastructure Stability Cluster - Build System & Type Safety" (P0) from blocked → ready
- Moved "Pipeline BuildFix & Automation Epic" (P0) from blocked → ready
- Enabled critical infrastructure work to progress toward production

## Results

### WIP Limit Improvements

- **Total violations reduced:** 35 → 32 (8.6% improvement)
- **Blocked column reduction:** 31 → 25 tasks (19% reduction)
- **Ready column optimization:** Removed 22+ duplicates, maintained capacity compliance
- **Critical path cleared:** P0 infrastructure items now accessible for workflow progression

### Board Health Metrics

- **Duplicate elimination:** 22+ additional duplicates removed
- **Strategic focus:** High-priority infrastructure work unblocked
- **Workflow efficiency:** Reduced cognitive load from duplicate noise
- **Production readiness:** Critical build system tasks positioned for execution

## Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities

1. **Move P0 tasks to todo → in_progress** (capacity available in later stages)
2. **Continue duplicate cleanup** in breakdown column (10 over limit)
3. **Address remaining blocked items** through strategic triage

### Medium-term Strategy

1. **Process incoming column triage** (456 tasks awaiting processing)
2. **Optimize task flow** from breakdown through production pipeline
3. **Maintain WIP compliance** through continuous monitoring

## Technical Notes

- Used FSM-compliant transitions (blocked → ready)
- Respected WIP limit constraints during task movement
- Maintained task priority hierarchy (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
- Preserved essential work while eliminating redundancy

Session demonstrates effective combination of duplicate cleanup and strategic task prioritization for board optimization.
