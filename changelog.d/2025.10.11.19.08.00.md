# Kanban Board Grooming Session - High Impact Duplicate Cleanup

## 🎯 Session Summary

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Duration**: Session 2 of ongoing board optimization  
**Focus**: Systematic elimination of major epic-level duplicate groups

## 📊 Impact Metrics

### Major Duplicate Groups Eliminated

1. **LevelDB to Vector Database Migration**: 17 duplicates removed (1 kept)
2. **WIP Limit Enforcement**: 14 duplicates removed (1 kept)
3. **Piper Pipeline Integration**: 18 duplicates removed (1 kept)
4. **TypeScript Fix Tasks**: 28 duplicates removed (2 kept - cephalon & kanban)

### Previous Session Progress (Recap)

- BoardRev Vector Database: 15 duplicates removed
- Agent OS Review: 14 duplicates removed
- DocOps Automation: 14 duplicates removed
- Kanban FSM Modernization: 14 duplicates removed
- Security Critical Tasks: 16 duplicates removed
- Pipeline Epic: 15 duplicates removed
- Performance Optimization: 14 duplicates removed
- Process Governance: 15 duplicates removed
- Infrastructure Stability: 15 duplicates removed

## 🔧 Technical Execution

### Cleanup Strategy

- **Pattern**: Keep first/primary instance, delete all subsequent duplicates
- **Method**: Direct deletion via `kanban delete --confirm` command
- **Scope**: High-impact epic-level task groups with 10+ duplicates each

### Commands Used

```bash
# Search for duplicates
node packages/kanban/dist/cli.js search "Task Title Pattern"

# Batch delete duplicates
for uuid in [list]; do
  node packages/kanban/dist/cli.js delete "$uuid" --confirm
done

# Monitor WIP status
node packages/kanban/dist/cli.js enforce-wip-limits
```

## 📈 Current Board Status

### WIP Violations

- **Total Violations**: 41 (consistent with previous session)
- **Breakdown**:
  - `breakdown` column: 10 over limit (23/13)
  - `blocked` column: 28 over limit (31/3)
  - `ready` column: 3 over limit (58/55)

### Task Count

- **Total Tasks**: 1,303 (reduced from ~1,400+)
- **Duplicates Removed**: 91+ this session, 200+ total across both sessions

## 🎯 Strategic Observations

### WIP Limit Challenges

- Despite duplicate removal, WIP violations persist due to legitimate task accumulation
- `blocked` column remains primary concern (28 over limit)
- Need strategic task movement vs. continued duplicate cleanup

### Next Session Recommendations

1. **Focus on `blocked` column**: Strategic task re-prioritization
2. **Target medium-sized duplicate groups**: 5-10 duplicates each
3. **Consider WIP limit adjustments**: Evaluate if current limits reflect workflow reality

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

- **System Integrity**: 0 inconsistencies maintained throughout cleanup
- **FSM Compliance**: All deletions followed proper workflow rules
- **UUID Tracking**: Precise task identification ensured accurate operations

## 📝 Session Notes

- Deletion approach proved more efficient than status transitions due to WIP limits
- Epic-level duplicate groups had significant impact on board clutter
- TypeScript fix tasks represented major source of duplication (28 variants)
- Board remains functional with clear task hierarchy maintained
