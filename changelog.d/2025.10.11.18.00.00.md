# Fixed BuildFix Pipeline Branch Noise

## Changes

- Removed all 300+ buildfix branches that were creating noise
- Updated buildfix pipeline configuration to use batch processing instead of per-error branching
- Changed from `--git per-error` to `--git batch` to group multiple errors in single branches
- Changed from `--commit-on always` to `--commit-on success` to only commit when fixes are successful
- Added `--max-errors-per-branch 10` to limit errors per branch
- Reduced `--max-cycles` from 5 to 3 to prevent infinite loops
- Added timeout configurations: 5 minutes for error detection, 10 minutes for iteration
- Set `--push false` to keep branches local for review before pushing

## Impact

- Eliminates branch noise in the repository
- Improves pipeline performance and reliability
- Maintains fix functionality while reducing overhead
- Provides better control over the automated fixing process
