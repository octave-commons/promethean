# Fix Missing Custom Checks in Kanban Transition Rules

## Problem
Users encountered "Custom check not found: task-selected-for-work?" error messages when moving tasks from todo to in_progress column in the kanban board.

## Root Cause
The transition rule from "todo" to "in_progress" referenced a custom check `"task-selected-for-work?"` that was not defined in either:
1. The `customChecks` section of the JSON configuration (`promethean.kanban.json`)
2. The Clojure DSL implementation file (`docs/agile/rules/kanban-transitions.clj`)

## Solution
1. **Added missing custom checks to JSON configuration**:
   - `task-selected-for-work?` - validates task selection for active work
   - `change-approved?` - validates review approval (references existing function)
   - `documentation-complete?` - validates documentation completion (references existing function)

2. **Implemented missing Clojure function**:
   - Added `task-selected-for-work?` function to `kanban-transitions.clj`
   - Function validates that task has proper priority, title, and required tool/env tags
   - Other functions (`review-approved?`, `documentation-complete?`) were already implemented

## Files Modified
- `promethean.kanban.json` - Added missing custom check definitions
- `docs/agile/rules/kanban-transitions.clj` - Implemented `task-selected-for-work?` function

## Testing
- ✅ todo → in_progress transition works without errors
- ✅ review → document transition works without errors  
- ✅ document → done transition works without errors
- ✅ Kanban system health confirmed - all commands working

## Impact
Users will no longer see "Custom check not found" error messages when moving tasks between kanban columns. The transition validation system now works as intended with all custom checks properly defined and implemented.
