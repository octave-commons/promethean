# Agent Model Optimization Implementation

## Summary

Finalized agent model assignments based on comprehensive security analysis and model research. Implemented optimal model configurations for read-only agents with specialized reasoning effort settings and fallback strategies.

## Changes Made

### 🧠 Model Configuration Updates

- **Cleaned up model definitions**: Removed error/duplicate entries, optimized for performance
- **Added reasoning effort settings**: Configured appropriate effort levels per agent category
- **Specialized temperature settings**: Tuned for optimal performance per use case

### 🎯 Agent Model Assignments

#### Code-Focused Agents

- **Agents**: code-reviewer, clojure-meta-programmer
- **Primary**: qwen2.5-coder:7b (specialized code analysis)
- **Fallback**: qwen2.5:7b (strong general code understanding)
- **Settings**: Medium reasoning effort, temperature 0.2

#### Documentation-Focused Agents

- **Agents**: code-documenter, board-task-reviewer
- **Primary**: qwen3:8b (excellent documentation analysis)
- **Fallback**: qwen2.5:7b (good general analysis)
- **Settings**: Medium reasoning effort, temperature 0.3

#### Architecture/Planning Agents

- **Agents**: system-architect, principal-architect, meta-agent
- **Primary**: qwen3:14b (strong reasoning for complex tasks)
- **Fallback**: gpt-oss:20b (good architectural analysis)
- **Settings**: High reasoning effort, temperature 0.2

#### Security-Focused Agents

- **Agents**: devsecops-engineer, kanban-code-reviewer
- **Primary**: gpt-oss:20b (strong security analysis)
- **Fallback**: qwen3:14b (good general security)
- **Settings**: High reasoning effort, temperature 0.1

#### Operational Agents

- **Agents**: kanban-board-enforcer, ava-test-generator
- **Primary**: qwen3:8b (efficient for routine tasks)
- **Fallback**: qwen2.5:7b (reliable backup)
- **Settings**: Low reasoning effort, temperature 0.3

### 🛡️ Security & Performance Features

- **Fallback strategy**: Automatic model fallback on failure with 2 retry attempts
- **Performance monitoring**: Enabled for tracking model effectiveness
- **Specialization tags**: Added for better model routing and optimization

## Impact

- **91% reduction in unrestricted access** (from previous security analysis)
- **Optimized performance** for read-only agents with specialized models
- **Improved reliability** with fallback mechanisms
- **Enhanced security** with appropriate model assignments per category

## Next Steps

- Monitor model performance and adjust settings as needed
- Collect feedback on agent effectiveness with new models
- Consider additional optimization based on usage patterns

## Files Modified

- `opencode.json`: Updated model configurations and agent assignments
