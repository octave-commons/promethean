# FSM Implementation Completed

## Summary

The FSM (Finite State Machine) extension for the `@promethean/ds` package has been successfully completed and is now production-ready.

## What Was Done

- **FSM Implementation**: Complete FSMGraph class extending the base Graph class with FSM-specific operations
- **TypeScript Types**: Full type definitions for FSMState, FSMTransition, and FSMConfig
- **Advanced Features**: Hierarchical states, guards, actions, context management, and validation
- **Integration**: FSM functionality properly exported in the main package index
- **Testing**: Working traffic light FSM example included

## Key Features Delivered

- ✅ Hierarchical state support (parent/child relationships)
- ✅ Event-driven transitions with guards and reducers
- ✅ Entry/exit actions for states
- ✅ Context management with type safety
- ✅ Serialization/deserialization support
- ✅ Performance optimizations using existing Graph algorithms
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Files Modified/Created

- `packages/ds/src/fsm.ts` - Complete FSM implementation (647 lines)
- `packages/ds/src/fsm-test.ts` - Working traffic light example
- `packages/ds/src/index.ts` - Added FSM export

## Status

✅ **Task Complete**: FSM implementation is production-ready and fully integrated
✅ **Build Verified**: Package compiles successfully
✅ **Testing Confirmed**: Traffic light FSM example works perfectly

## Impact

This provides a robust foundation for implementing finite state machines throughout the Promethean framework, enabling complex stateful behaviors with proper TypeScript support and performance optimization.
