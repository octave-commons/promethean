# Pantheon FP Implementation Complete

## What Was Done

- Created `@promethean/pantheon-fp` package with clean functional programming architecture
- Implemented core ports and adapters pattern:
  - `ToolPort`, `ContextPort`, `ActorPort` interfaces
  - Context adapter with compile/get/save functionality
  - Actor adapter with tick/create/destroy functionality
  - Orchestrator for coordinating actors and contexts
- Built minimal CLI with two commands:
  - `context:compile` - Compiles context from sources with text
  - `actors:tick` - Ticks an actor by ID
- Fixed TypeScript compilation issues and added proper types
- Successfully tested both CLI commands

## Current State

- ✅ Package builds successfully with `tsc`
- ✅ CLI help works: `pnpm --filter @promethean/pantheon-fp exec node dist/cli/index.js --help`
- ✅ Context compile works: `context:compile --sources sessions,agent-tasks --text "hello world"`
- ✅ Actor tick works (shows expected error for non-existent actor)
- ✅ ESM-only module system
- ✅ GPL-3.0 licensing

## Next Steps

- Integrate with `@promethean/agent-state` for state management
- Create `@promethean/pantheon-mcp` for MCP tool integration
- Merge best parts from existing `pantheon-core` LLM adapters
- Add persistence layer integration
- Implement actor lifecycle management
