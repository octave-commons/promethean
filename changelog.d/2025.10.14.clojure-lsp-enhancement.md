# Enhanced Clojure LSP Configuration

## Changes

### LSP Configuration Updates

- **File**: `.lsp/config.edn`
- **Added support for Babashka (`.bb`) files** in addition to existing `.clj`, `.cljs`, `.cljc`
- **Expanded source paths** to include:
  - `mk` - Root-level Clojure utilities
  - `docs/agile/rules` - Documentation-based Clojure files
  - `packages/clj-hacks/src` - Native Clojure package sources
  - `packages/clj-hacks/verify.clj` - Standalone verification script
- **Enhanced test paths** to include `packages/clj-hacks/test`
- **Added ignore patterns** for temporary test directories and build artifacts
- **Added project-specific configuration** for clj-hacks package

### OpenCode Configuration Updates

- **File**: `opencode.json`
- **Updated LSP settings** to match comprehensive configuration
- **Added `.bb` extension support** to OpenCode LSP integration
- **Synchronized source and test paths** with `.lsp/config.edn`
- **Added project specifications** for shadow-cljs and clj-hacks

## Impact

### Developer Experience

- **Complete Clojure ecosystem support** across all file types
- **Improved code completion** and navigation for Babashka scripts
- **Better error detection** and linting coverage
- **Enhanced refactoring capabilities** across all Clojure sources

### Project Coverage

- **All package structures** in the monorepo are now indexed
- **Root-level utilities** are properly recognized
- **Native Clojure projects** with custom structures are supported
- **Documentation-based Clojure files** are included in LSP analysis

### Performance

- **Optimized indexing** by excluding temporary and build directories
- **Project-specific configurations** reduce unnecessary scanning
- **Efficient path resolution** for large monorepo structure

## Verification

The configuration has been tested to ensure:

- All Clojure file extensions are recognized
- Source paths cover the entire codebase
- Test paths include all test directories
- Ignore patterns prevent indexing of build artifacts
- Project specifications work for both shadow-cljs and native projects

## Files Modified

- `.lsp/config.edn` - Main LSP configuration
- `opencode.json` - OpenCode LSP integration settings
- `docs/clojure-lsp-configuration.md` - Documentation (new file)

This update provides comprehensive LSP support for the entire Promethean Framework's Clojure ecosystem.
