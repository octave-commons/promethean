- add `mcp.validate-config` workflow linter with stronger endpoint checks and include it in discovery bundles
- seed examples for high-traffic tools (`apply_patch`, `exec.run`, `pnpm.runScript`) to enrich `mcp.help`
- document endpoint workflows/expectations in `promethean.mcp.json` so discovery surfaces intended usage
