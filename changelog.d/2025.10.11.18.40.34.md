- add a BuildFix CLI with `file`, `folder`, and `create-mutaant` subcommands that stream reports or write fixes across models
- reflow benchmark execution to iterate models-first by default and update supporting utilities
- surface a `createMutaant` generator built on ts-morph for seeded error mutation batches
- extend BuildFix internals with attempt histories, diff-ready content capture, and CLI integration hooks
