- ✅ Included BuildFix-specific usage examples with unified CLI
- ✅ Documented BuildFix configuration options and provider setup
- ✅ Added BuildFix to provider comparison tables
- ✅ Enhanced CLI examples with BuildFix-specific commands
- ✅ Added BuildFix provider configuration documentation

### 2. BuildFix Package README (`packages/buildfix/README.md`)

- ✅ Updated migration notice to reflect completed integration
- ✅ Added "Unified CLI Usage" section as recommended approach
- ✅ Documented both unified CLI and legacy direct usage
- ✅ Updated migration guide to show integration completion
- ✅ Added comprehensive examples of unified CLI usage

### 3. AGENTS.md (`AGENTS.md`)

- ✅ Added "BuildFix Provider Guidelines" section
- ✅ Documented BuildFix agent workflows and best practices
- ✅ Included BuildFix configuration examples
- ✅ Added BuildFix to programming style considerations
- ✅ Provided specific CLI commands for different scenarios

## Key Integration Points

### Unified CLI Commands

```bash
# Quick validation
pnpm --filter @promethean/benchmark benchmark --providers buildfix-local --iterations 3

# Comprehensive testing
pnpm --filter @promethean/benchmark benchmark --providers buildfix-local --suite buildfix-massive

# Model comparison
pnpm --filter @promethean/benchmark benchmark --providers buildfix-local --models qwen3:8b,qwen3:14b
```

### Provider Configuration

- BuildFix configured as `buildfix-local` provider type
- Supports Ollama models: qwen3:8b, qwen3:14b, gpt-oss:20b-cloud
- Options include errorContext, fixStrategy, maxRetries, timeoutMs
- Current success rate: 0% (integration complete, optimization in progress)

### Benefits of Integration

- Unified interface across all benchmark providers
- Enhanced resource monitoring for BuildFix operations
- Standardized reporting with BuildFix-specific metrics
- Easier CI/CD integration with consistent CLI patterns
- Side-by-side comparison with other providers

## Migration Status

- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Integration notice and documentation updates
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: New benchmark package adoption
- 🔄 **Phase 3 In Progress**: Optimization and performance improvements

## Next Steps

- Monitor BuildFix performance via unified benchmark CLI
- Continue optimization to improve success rates
- Add more BuildFix-specific benchmark suites
- Enhance error type-specific testing capabilities

## Impact

- Users can now use BuildFix via the unified benchmark CLI
- Consistent experience across all benchmark providers
- Better resource monitoring and reporting for BuildFix
- Simplified CI/CD integration for BuildFix testing
- Enhanced comparability between BuildFix and other providers
