# Fixed Kanban UI MIME Type Error

Fixed the MIME type issue in the Kanban UI server that was preventing JavaScript modules from loading properly in browsers.

## Changes

- Changed content type from `application/javascript` to `text/javascript` for all JS assets
- Enhanced CORS headers for ES modules including `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`
- Fixed duplicate `export` keyword in kanban.ts that was causing build errors

## Impact

- Virtual scroll component now loads properly
- All JavaScript modules serve with correct MIME types
- Better cross-origin compatibility for ES modules
