# OpenCode Unified - Development Environment Fixed

## Summary

Fixed missing index.html file that prevented Electron application from starting in development mode.

## What Was Done

1. **Identified Issue**: Electron application was missing required index.html file and static directory structure
2. **Created Static Directory**: Added `static/` directory for frontend assets
3. **Created index.html**: Added basic HTML structure with:
   - Proper HTML5 doctype and meta tags
   - Dark theme styling appropriate for code editor
   - Loading indicator for initial app state
   - Script tag pointing to compiled ClojureScript (`dist/public/js/main.js`)
4. **Created Output Directory**: Added `dist/public/` directory for ClojureScript compilation output
5. **Verified Development Setup**: Confirmed both TypeScript and ClojureScript watch processes start correctly

## Current Status

- **Development Environment**: ✅ Working (`pnpm dev` starts successfully)
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ Watching and compiling correctly
- **ClojureScript Compilation**: ✅ Shadow-CLJS watching and compiling to `dist/public/js/main.js`
- **HTTP Server**: ✅ Available at http://localhost:8080
- **nREPL Server**: ✅ Available on port 37473
- **Electron Integration**: ✅ Ready to load index.html

## Technical Details

- Shadow-CLJS config outputs to `dist/public/js/main.js` as specified in `shadow-cljs.edn`
- HTML file correctly references compiled JavaScript with proper relative path
- Development server serves files from `dist/public/` directory
- Both TypeScript and ClojureScript compilation run in parallel via `run-p`

## Files Created/Modified

- `static/index.html` - Main HTML file for Electron application
- `dist/public/` - Output directory for ClojureScript compilation
- Updated changelog with development environment fix

## Next Steps

The development environment is now fully functional. Users can run:

- `pnpm dev` - Start both TypeScript and ClojureScript watch modes
- `pnpm dev:typescript` - TypeScript only watch mode
- `pnpm dev:clojurescript` - ClojureScript only watch mode
- `pnpm start:electron` - Build and launch Electron application
