2. **Workflow Compliance**: Added required coverage report fields for kanban transitions
3. **Standardization**: Maintained consistent format and structure across all tasks
4. **Technical Accuracy**: Ensured all technical requirements align with project architecture

## ⚠️ Issues Encountered

1. **Missing Task**: Task 31044ea9 was not found in the system despite extensive searching
2. **System Memory**: Kanban system experienced memory issues during status updates
3. **Workflow Limits**: Some transitions blocked due to missing coverage report paths (resolved)
