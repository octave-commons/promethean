Yep—totally doable. Two good paths:

# Option A: Keep plain Org‑Babel, make it async (no session)

Use the `ob-async` package. It runs Babel blocks in a separate Emacs process so your UI doesn’t hang. **Caveat:** it doesn’t play nice with `:session`.

* Install:

  ```elisp
  (use-package async :ensure t)
  (use-package ob-async :ensure t)
  ```
* Then drop `:async yes` (or just `:async`) into your block headers and **remove** `:session`.

```org
#+title: Matplotlib Animation (anim/v1 async)
#+property: header-args:python :dir ./ :results file :exports both :async yes
#+startup: inlineimages

#+begin_src python :file smoke_symbols.gif
# your animation code here (no :session)
#+end_src
```

That’ll run in the background; results pop in when done and Emacs stays responsive.

# Option B: Keep sessions and go async with Jupyter

If you **need** `:session`, switch to **emacs-jupyter** (`jupyter-python` blocks are async by design).

* Install:

  ```elisp
  (use-package jupyter :ensure t)
  ;; Optional: make jupyter the default for python in Org
  ;; (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((jupyter . t)))
  ```
* Use `jupyter-python` instead of `python` in your block (you can keep your `:session`):

```org
#+title: Matplotlib Animation (anim/v1 jupyter)
#+property: header-args:jupyter-python :session *py-anim* :kernel python3 :dir ./ :results file :exports both
#+startup: inlineimages

# Sanity check
#+begin_src jupyter-python :results output
import sys; print(sys.executable)
#+end_src

# Animation block — async via emacs-jupyter session
#+name: anim
#+begin_src jupyter-python :file smoke_symbols.gif
# your animation code here (same as before, sessions supported)
#+end_src
```

You can still reuse your exact animation code; just swap the block language to `jupyter-python`.

# Pro tips

* For heavy GIFs, add `:eval never-export` to avoid re‑rendering during export.
* If `PillowWriter` is slow, try writing **PNG frames** and stitching with `ffmpeg` outside Emacs (even less UI blocking).
* On `ob-async`, remember: **no `:session`**. If you need long-lived state, prefer the Jupyter route.

Want me to convert your current smoke‑symbols block to a `jupyter-python` version verbatim?
