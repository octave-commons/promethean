I'm not sure where I want the piper dev ui stuff...
I'm in that sort of uncertain organizational brain mode right now.
Stuff keeps just ending up in the package I thought about doing it in.
Which is fine...
For now... it's fine...
it's probably fine forever, and each one of the UIs exists both "in isolation" and "in conjunction" with the whole system.
So I can test/use parts independently.
And I don't end up not being able to use any of the system because one part of it is broken.

I don't have an easy way of sharing frontend components across packages right now...

I really want to avoid getting entangled with a bundler framework.
If I could just run everything using pretty vanilla js.
typescript and eslint are enough effort.

I want to think about this whole thing as basiclly an IDE using markdown.
It has some overlap with a KMS like obsidian, except the entire point is to create working code
from documentation.

So code is a part of the system.
Obsidian has hacky code integration at best.
