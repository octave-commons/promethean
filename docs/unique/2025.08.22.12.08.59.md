If my limit is 30 commands I am gonna need to:
A. Consolodate existing actions into others with additional parameters
B. Limit the number of actions 
C. Split the actions up into multiple services


We can do A and B right now through descriptions to the agents.
C will require us to find multiple domains to put different parts of the system behind.
That is not automatable, and it means *even more services*
Complexity is already very high.

I am confident we can get our current endpoints down below 30. We only start splitting up the actions into multiple services/domains when it becomes impossible or unreasonable to consolidate them.

I think we can get better codex context thinking about it if all searches have a ttl on them...
It's gotta be more complicated than that though...
you need a special agent who's job it is to ...

markdown is designed to compile to html...
html has the dom... the dom allows a system to be mutated and changed...
