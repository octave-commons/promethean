If my limit is 30 commands I am gonna need to:
A. Consolodate existing actions into others with additional parameters
B. Limit the number of actions 
C. Split the actions up into multiple services


We can do A and B right now through descriptions to the agents.
C will require us to find multiple domains to put different parts of the system behind.
That is not automatable, and it means *even more services*
Complexity is already very high.
