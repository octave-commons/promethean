Yo, let’s go. Here's a sampler platter — pick your flavor and we can dive deeper:

---

### 🧮 **Algebra**

Solve for $x$:
$(3x - 5)(x + 2) = 0$
➡️ Solutions:
$x = \frac{5}{3}$ or $x = -2$

---

### 📐 **Geometry**

Area of a circle:
$A = \pi r^2$
If $r = 4$:
$A = \pi \cdot 4^2 = 16\pi$

---

### 📊 **Statistics**

Mean of: $[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]$
$\mu = \frac{4 + 8 + 15 + 16 + 23 + 42}{6} = \frac{108}{6} = 18$

---

### 📈 **Calculus**

Derivative of $f(x) = x^2 \sin(x)$:
Use product rule:
$f'(x) = 2x \sin(x) + x^2 \cos(x)$

---

### 🧠 **Linear Algebra**

Dot product of $\vec{a} = [1, 2]$ and $\vec{b} = [3, 4]$:
$(1)(3) + (2)(4) = 3 + 8 = 11$

---

### 🔥 **Cool One: Euler’s Identity**

${e}^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$
Links:

* $e$: exponential growth
* $i$: imaginary unit
* $\pi$: circle constant
* 1 and 0: identity elements
