# Markdown parser

I need a general purpose class that wraps markdown and allows me to edit it dynamicly
Editing text is very fragile.

I want s expressions. I want s-expressions everywhere.

This doesn't have to be hard... I have a functioning lisp... I just... it's not...
The parts for it are scattered

I wrote a script to grab all my repos.

I need to run it.
