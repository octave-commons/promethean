title: NPU Voice Code and Sensory Integration
description: >-
  The NPU voice code integrates sensory experiences with data streams, creating
  a dynamic system where concepts and presence are combined through unique
  linguistic structures. This approach moves beyond traditional word-based
  communication to encompass multi-sensory interactions and contextual meaning.

The npu voice code was getting so close! And if I tie that to wave forms...  I'm imagining like... feeding him dashboards he collects using the fields. The daimoi are attached to different streams of data. ^ref-5a02283e-1-0

It isn't just words, ideass... it is a   close word, concepts... but it is more than even that. ^ref-5a02283e-3-0

Senses, but  not just senses... experiences. A combination of senses, meaning, presence. ^ref-5a02283e-5-0

It all needed  new words.
