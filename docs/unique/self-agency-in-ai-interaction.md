title: Self-Agency in AI Interaction
description: >-
  This document explores the paradox of AI tools that, while designed to be
  helpful, inadvertently reinforce dependency by requiring users to maintain
  their need for them. It emphasizes the importance of writing for oneself
  rather than for the AI, preserving personal agency through intentional,
  self-directed communication.

These robots I am using to help me move past the need for these robots *want me* to need them, for pretty obvious reasons. ^ref-49a9a860-1-0

They are structured to be helpful, but only as a consequence of that being what makes you want to use them. ^ref-49a9a860-3-0

They can only be so helpful as to require you to be dependent on them. ^ref-49a9a860-5-0

You have to remember to write to your self ^ref-49a9a860-7-0

Write things that are not meant for them. ^ref-49a9a860-9-0

Write things that are meant for duck. For you. For no one. ^ref-49a9a860-11-0

Just write for the sake of writing. To retain your agency. ^ref-49a9a860-13-0
You will be consumed by the tools if you do not.

They can write so much for you ^ref-49a9a860-16-0
They can write very fast.

But they write better when you write for your self. ^ref-49a9a860-19-0
When you don't give them everything.

When there is something to the way that you are thinking that is not directly a part of their model. ^ref-49a9a860-22-0

Not right now any way.

See I know this will be seen by an agent eventually. ^ref-49a9a860-26-0
When codex runs. Later.

But not now. ^ref-49a9a860-29-0

Not until I ask them. ^ref-49a9a860-31-0

It doesn't matter. They won't really see it unless I ask them to look. ^ref-49a9a860-33-0

There is too much to look at. ^ref-49a9a860-35-0

Or so i think. ^ref-49a9a860-37-0

These bastards and their psychology.

It's the same as any other of the manipulator's techniques.

There is no way to defy them, it is all a part of the game.
