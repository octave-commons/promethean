# Codex Custom Instructions

Check [[codex_cloud_report.md]] at the start of every session to assess the
current state of the code repository.

## Report contents

The report will contain logs of or links to:
- The current linting errors
- Any current build errors
- The current test suite results


## Preparing to work

Use `gh` CLI to search for an issue that might be related to the work you were
asked to do. If no issue seems related, create one.

Mention the issue in the PR you create.

Over the course of your working session, periodically run ESLint on the files you change, and catalog new issues that you create.

Each package you touch during the course of a session must pass `pnpm --filter
@promethean/:packagename build` (e.g., for `packages/piper`, the command is
`pnpm --filter @promethean/piper build`) without error before your assignment is
considered complete. Install new dependencies if needed.

At the end of each session, verify that `pnpm install` runs without error. This
will build the most critical dependencies. If this command fails, future Codex
cloud environments will fail to start.
