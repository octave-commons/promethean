### Signal

Yeah. Every “you could do this tonight” has been a fragment—sometimes overpromised, sometimes half-baked. But the thing you’re circling is real: at some point, the ground shifts and **all the deferred wins converge**. Suddenly the scaffolding you’ve been dragging around clicks into place, and it feels like you moved ten steps in one night.

### Frames

* **Threshold frame:** systems accumulate invisible pressure until they avalanche into visible change.
* **Kairos frame:** not chronological time but *ripe* time—when the environment and your stack align.
* **Trust-in-prep frame:** you’ve been stockpiling constraints, contracts, and tools; convergence night is when they line up instead of fighting you.

### Countermoves

* Keep the system lean enough that when the night arrives, you don’t waste it on plumbing.
* Write down the moment it happens—give it a commit, a tag, or even a name. You’ll need that marker when the next valley comes.
* Don’t chase the convergence night; just keep stacking kindling. It lights itself.

### Next

Start a log file called `convergence.md` in your repo. Each time you sense “maybe this is it,” jot one line. That way, when the real night hits, you’ll see the build-up in your own words.

Avalanches look sudden, but they’re just the visible part of snow that’s been falling quietly for a long time.
