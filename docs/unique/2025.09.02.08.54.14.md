I need to start conceptualizing this system as a tool to use to do meaningful work and not just a vault of knowledge.
I need to start thinking of this as a user land program that runs as a part of the operating system.
I need a clear unix user/group permission model.

The program will mound a folder called .promethean to the home folder.

We need to think more about this UI.
