description: >-
  A user-level OS integration tool designed to function as a seamless part of
  the operating system, providing a dedicated .promethe: folder for
  user-specific data with clear Unix permissions. Focuses on practical utility
  rather than knowledge storage, emphasizing real-world application through a
  minimal, permission-controlled interface.

I need to start conceptualizing this system as a tool to use to do meaningful work and not just a vault of knowledge.
I need to start thinking of this as a user land program that runs as a part of the operating system.
I need a clear unix user/group permission model.

The program will mound a folder called .promethean to the home folder.

We need to think more about this UI.
