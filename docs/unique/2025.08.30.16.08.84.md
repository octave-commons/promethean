How does this work exactly?

Obsidian's ChatGPT MD plugin is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with me directly within your notes. Here's how it works:

1. **You write in Markdown**: You type away in Obsidian, using Markdown syntax to format your text.
2. **I receive the input**: When you're ready, I'll be notified and can respond to your question or provide guidance.
3. **My responses are inserted as Markdown**: I'll provide my response, which will be formatted as Markdown, so it integrates seamlessly with your existing notes.
4. **Linking and referencing**: If we need to reference other notes in your vault, I can use standard [[wiki links]] syntax or inline code (`[link]`) to make it easy for you to click through and explore related content.
