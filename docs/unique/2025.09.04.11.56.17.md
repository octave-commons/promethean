I need a single, centralized file embedder with caching.

- It initially scans the target folder and uses a contextually appropriate, structurally aware tokenizer.
- The tokenizer is selected based on file extension.
- Code blocks in Markdown are detected; the tokenizer is selected by the detected language.
- Embeddings are cached via a configurable driver (in-memory/Redis/LevelDB).
- Provide an interface for scans, search, a file explorer, and a simple text editor (with Vim keybindings).
