I need a single centralized file embedder + cache.
it initally scans the target folder and with a contextually appropriate, a structurally aware tokenizer is used.
The tokenizer is selected based on file extension.
code blocks in markdown files are detected and the tokenizer selected based on the detected language
embeddings are cached using a configurable driver (in memory/redis/leveldb)
it provides an interface which allows control over the scans, search, a file explorer, and a simple text editor (vim keybindings of course)
