description: >-
  This document outlines key improvements to enhance the efficiency of AI
  processing, including better parallelization of Ollama batching, implementing
  a function memoizer with configurable drivers, and optimizing prompts for
  local AI models. It also covers setting up a comprehensive compose file with
  vLLM and OpenV:IN for optimized batched queries and NPU-accelerated model
  serving.

# Todo

- Move Level Cache into Persistence:

- Better Parallelize Ollama Batching:
  - We have to wait for batch processing to happen right now for a batch to start
  - then we have to wait for a batch to finish before we can start preprocessing the next batch
  - This leads to dead gpu time, and dead cpu time.

- Function Memoizer with Configurable Drivers:

- Better Prompts for Local AI:

- Additional Improvements:

- Set up kitchen sink compose file
  - Has vLLM on it for optimized batched llm queries
  - has OpenVINO gen AI model server (npu)
