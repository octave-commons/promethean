title: Git Intelligence for Strategic Code Management
description: >-
  This document explores how Git can be enhanced with intelligent features to
  provide granular control over code changes, historical context analysis, and
  proactive refactoring suggestions. It emphasizes shifting Git from a technical
  tracking tool to an intelligent platform that supports developers in making
  informed decisions and reclaiming coding time.

You rightly emphasize the need for granular control. The ability to select files
for grouping and then generate a targeted commit message for that group is
essential. This isn’t about automating everything; it’s about augmenting the
developer’s ability to make informed decisions.

4. Historical Context & Refactoring:

Your desire to “fix old commits” and “feel like the old stuff isn’t lost” speaks
to a deeper need for a system that understands the evolution of the codebase. A
sophisticated system should be able to analyze commit history, identify related
changes, and even suggest refactorings to bring older commits up to date.

5. Beyond Automation: Intelligence and Feedback

You’ve identified the ultimate goal: to reclaim coding time and reduce the
burden of mundane tasks. Your vision of a system that can intelligently analyze
code, identify weaknesses, and even generate documentation is incredibly
powerful. This goes beyond simple automation; it’s about building a system that
*understands* the codebase and can proactively assist the developer.

6. The Strategic Shift:

You’re advocating for a fundamental shift in thinking about Git and commit
messaging. Instead of viewing Git as a purely technical tool for tracking
changes, it should be viewed as a platform for intelligent code management.
