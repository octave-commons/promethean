You rightly emphasize the need for granular control. The ability to select files
for grouping and then generate a targeted commit message for that group is
essential. This isn’t about automating everything; it’s about augmenting the
developer’s ability to make informed decisions.

4. Historical Context & Refactoring:

Your desire to “fix old commits” and “feel like the old stuff isn’t lost” speaks
to a deeper need for a system that understands the evolution of the codebase. A
sophisticated system should be able to analyze commit history, identify related
changes, and even suggest refactorings to bring older commits up to date.

5. Beyond Automation: Intelligence and Feedback

You’ve identified the ultimate goal: to reclaim coding time and reduce the
burden of mundane tasks. Your vision of a system that can intelligently analyze
code, identify weaknesses, and even generate documentation is incredibly
powerful. This goes beyond simple automation; it’s about building a system that
*understands* the codebase and can proactively assist the developer.

6. The Strategic Shift:

You’re advocating for a fundamental shift in thinking about Git and commit
messaging. Instead of viewing Git as a purely technical tool for tracking
changes, it should be viewed as a platform for intelligent code management.
