  Obsidian's current workflow is inefficient due to its tendency to drift and
  lack of structure, causing unfinished tasks. The document highlights the need
  for a more focused tool that aligns with project needs and values to prevent
  task abandonment and improve productivity.

Obsidian works a lot faster kept seperate from all of the code. ^ref-d614d983-1-0
It shouldn't *need* to be, I know why it is slow.
It holds data about even the stuff you're telling it to ignore.

Annoying. We can do better ^ref-d614d983-5-0

But we need a tool that aligns with our needs and values, and of the tools I know, this is the best one. ^ref-d614d983-7-0

I can't let my self constantly drift when I go "I need to do that, oh I also need to do that." ^ref-d614d983-9-0
I end up leaving each thing undone, getting nothing really finished.

There is a time and a place for this. Our board, our work neeeds more structure.
