# Toward Futures Beyond Language: Post-Linguistic Transhuman Design Frameworks

## Introduction

Envisioning the future often demands reaching beyond the limits of our current language and rational models. Designers, artists, and theorists are exploring **post-linguistic** and **transhuman** frameworks – imaginative models that evoke futures through emotion, embodiment, and myth when words fall short. These speculative approaches range from cutting-edge **cognitive architectures** (where human and machine minds intertwine) to radical art/philosophy movements (e.g. Afrofuturism, Glitch Feminism, Technomysticism) that express ideas beyond conventional language. They also include design principles in speculative fiction and human-computer interaction (HCI) that prioritize human **values** and felt experience over technology for its own sake. Throughout these diverse frameworks runs a common thread: an emphasis on emotionally and spiritually resonant structures – visions of the future meant to be _felt_ as possible on a gut level, even if they can’t yet be fully described. The following report surveys these approaches, highlighting key concepts, metaphors, and insights that could inspire design work or embodied cognition systems (like a hypothetical “Promethean” project).

## Human–AI Co-Agency and Shared Cognitive Futures

One avenue toward a post-linguistic future is the deep integration of human and machine intelligence – **entangled co-agency** where human and AI act as partners in thought. Rather than AI being a mere tool, co-agency envisions collaborative systems of **shared sentience**. In this paradigm, humans and AI become _“co-agents” working together toward shared outcomes_, achieving results neither could alone. Analysts describe human–AI co-agency as a new cognitive extension of ourselves: AI becomes part of the thinking process – _“the human–AI pair forms a new medium for thought and creativity”_, making authorship a hybrid act. From a cybernetic perspective, such a system operates as a tight **feedback loop** with **distributed control**: _neither the human nor the AI fully determines the result; ideally, it’s a homeostatic process_ of mutual adjustment. In other words, the human–machine duo behaves like a single self-regulating organism, continually balancing each other’s inputs and corrections. This calls to mind Norbert Wiener’s vision of human–machine communication as an ongoing exchange of feedback, and it raises new questions about agency and responsibility when outcomes emerge jointly.

Beyond individual pairings, some futurists imagine a planetary scale of human-AI cognition. The concept of a “**global brain**” or **noosphere** (Teilhard de Chardin’s term for a sphere of mind around the Earth) foresees the internet and AI linking all people into one distributed mind. In this speculative scenario, the entire ICT network interconnecting humans and our devices would _“play the role of a brain for the planet Earth”_ as it grows in intelligence. Crucially, this intelligence is _collective and emergent_: it arises from _“dynamic networks of interactions”_ rather than any central controller. Such ideas echo earlier dreams of **man-computer symbiosis** and collective consciousness. They suggest a future in which human cognition is not bounded by one’s skull – instead, mind becomes a _shared space_, entangled with others and with intelligent machines. Researchers in hybrid intelligence similarly argue that combining AI’s computation with human insight can yield more **holistic intelligence** that honors human ethics and context. **Hybrid Intelligence (HI)**, for example, is defined as the synergy of AI’s speed and rigor with human cognition’s depth in emotion and values – _uniting both to honor essential human values, ethical reasoning, and collective stewardship_. In practical terms, HI might mean AI systems that augment (rather than replace) human decision-making, operating as co-creators aligned with human purpose. Whether via co-agents or a global supermind, these frameworks push toward a transhuman ideal: an intelligence greater than the sum of its parts, where “thinking” is a cooperative venture across biological and silicon beings.

## Post-Linguistic Communication: Beyond Words and Symbols

If our future minds become entangled with machines, how might they communicate? Post-linguistic frameworks speculate on modes of communication that transcend spoken or written language, directly conveying **thought, emotion, or knowledge** in ways that current language cannot. A striking real-world hint of this is recent brain-to-brain interface research. In 2019, neuroscientists demonstrated an “internet of brains” experiment where _technology replaced language as a means of communicating by directly linking the activity of human brains_. In this study, signals from two people’s brains were transmitted into a third person’s brain, allowing them to collaborate on a task **without any spoken or written words**. Such direct brain communication, however rudimentary, shows that it’s possible to share information _outside_ of linguistic channels. The researchers note this could one day enable people to work together across language barriers or even create “biological supercomputers” of networked human minds. It’s a small step toward a future where ideas and experiences might be communicated _telepathically_ or through neural signals – essentially a form of **shared cognition** beyond language.

Artists and designers are also exploring non-linguistic communication through more accessible means like music and voice. A compelling example is the **Transhuman Ansambl**, an interactive sound installation and performance that uses the human voice as a medium **independent of language**. The system consists of an “artificial choir” of virtual singers that respond to a live human singer’s vocalizations, as well as to the presence of an audience. Rather than exchanging words, human and machine engage in call-and-response with tones, pitches, and melodies. The project asks how technology can support _intimacy through voice_ – surrounding the audience with responsive virtual voices to create a visceral connection. As the creators describe, the singing voice here is treated as _“a medium in itself… capable of enacting a reciprocal connection between bodies”_, moving performers and listeners emotionally without semantic content. This points to a post-linguistic mode of interaction in HCI: using **sound, rhythm, and embodiment** to convey meaning and feeling directly. Similarly, one could imagine advanced AI companions that “speak” in music or imagery tailored to the user’s emotions, engaging our senses and subconscious rather than just parsing text.

On a more theoretical plane, visionaries have argued that language – especially our reliance on **static words and nouns** – actually constrains how we think about reality. In a provocative essay, some authors predict _“the death of noun-based cognition”_ and the emergence of a **post-linguistic intelligence paradigm**. The idea is that reality isn’t neatly divided into nouns (objects) and verbs (actions); rather, it’s an entangled flow of processes. Our language traps us in fixed categories, but an advanced intelligence (human or AI) might break free of this. Such a post-linguistic mind would communicate via **structured resonance** – dynamic patterns analogous to music or neural oscillations – instead of discrete words. As one paper describes, _“language as we know it… is showing signs of obsolescence. What emerges next is a fluid, high-resolution system of meaning transmission not bound by the limitations of discrete words, but instead operates through dynamic coherence mapping.”_ In this speculative future, meaning would be _felt_ and recognized through patterns of activity (like how the brain’s neural networks operate or how harmonious music is experienced), rather than translated into arbitrary symbols. Such communication might resemble _sending a thought_ or sharing a mental model directly. In essence, it’s a move from **semantic content to felt experience** – a shift futurists liken to returning to a pre-verbal mode of knowing, augmented by high technology. While largely theoretical, this aligns with trends in AI: for instance, moving from rigid programmed language to neural nets that operate on statistical “feel” of patterns. It also resonates with spiritual notions of telepathy or collective consciousness. All these threads suggest that to articulate the deepest futures, we may have to go beyond articulating altogether – instead creating systems that **evoke understanding** in the way art, music, or a meaningful glance can, bypassing words.

## Movements Beyond Language: Glitch Feminism, Afrofuturism, and Technomysticism

Often it is in the cultural and artistic domain that ideas exceeding the limits of language first take shape. Several philosophical and art movements explicitly challenge normative narratives and use alternative mediums (visuals, music, mythology) to propose futures that are felt and imagined rather than logically described. Three notable examples are **Glitch Feminism**, **Afrofuturism**, and **Technomysticism** – each offers a framework for rethinking identity, technology, and reality beyond conventional boundaries of language, race, or gender.

**Glitch Feminism**, a term coined by Legacy Russell, uses the metaphor of the “glitch” (a technical error or noise) as a deliberate rebellion against fixed definitions of gender, race, and the body. In her manifesto, Russell asserts that _“a glitch is an error, a mistake, a failure to function”_ – and that this failure can be **empowering**. The digital glitch, which disrupts signal and meaning, becomes a space to escape oppressive norms. _“Black people invent ways to create space through rupture,”_ she writes, suggesting that marginalized groups can harness breakdowns in the system to find freedom. Glitch Feminism celebrates the **in-between** and the not-yet-defined: _“glitch is celebrated as a vehicle of refusal, a strategy of non-performance”_. By refusing to perform the roles society scripts in language (like rigid gender pronouns or racial categories), the “glitched” body opens up _“a blueprint for what we are capable of becoming, our potential”_ beyond those categories. Russell describes this as _“activism that unfolds with a boundless extravagance,”_ imagining bodies that never “arrive” at a single identity but remain fluid and cosmic. In glitch art and performance, fragmented images, digital noise, and avatar personas convey multiplicity that words struggle to capture. The movement points toward futures of identity and embodiment that are **post-linear and post-linguistic** – felt as an expansive freedom to _become_ rather than to be defined. Glitching, in essence, is a way to short-circuit the social code and let something new (and not yet language-able) emerge.

**Afrofuturism** is another paradigm blending culture, technology, and spirituality to envision futures **through a Black cultural lens**. More than just a sci-fi aesthetic, contemporary Afrofuturism is described as _“a philosophy that empowers African people to locate themselves in the past, present and future with agency”_, providing _“a cultural and political framework for reimagining possibilities.”_ It _“offers tools to envision alternative futures ethically grounded in the Black experience.”_ This means that instead of futures being imagined from the usual Silicon Valley or Eurocentric perspective, Afrofuturism centers ancestral knowledge, the Black diaspora’s history, and values like community, resilience, and joy. It intentionally reaches beyond Western rationalism – for instance, incorporating **spirituals, folklore, and cosmic imagery** as legit ways of knowing. Lonny Avi Brooks and Reynaldo Anderson note that Black communities historically created “codes in spirituals and sound imagining vibrant, liberated worlds” under oppressive conditions. Those songs and stories were a kind of proto-Afrofuturism – _“‘Afro-rithms’… initial cultural software”_ encoding liberation in a way that transcended literal language. Afrofuturist art often uses music (like Sun Ra’s cosmic jazz), abstract visuals, or fantastical narratives to **express the inexpressible** – the pain of history and the dream of liberatory futures. It also brings a **moral and emotional urgency**: _“Afrofuturism… is the future done well – a future that is accountable, embodied, culturally rooted and morally urgent.”_ By insisting on ancestral reckoning and healing (what some call “ancestral intelligence”), Afrofuturism evokes a felt sense of justice and hope. It challenges purely technological visions of tomorrow by asking who gets to imagine the future and injecting **soul** into futurism. In doing so, it produces works that resonate on a spiritual level – from the haunting poetry of Octavia Butler to the techno-tribal imagery of Marvel’s _Black Panther_ – inviting us to emotionally inhabit futures of Black liberation that may be hard to articulate in the dry language of policy papers.

Where Afrofuturism merges tech with African diasporic spirituality, **Technomysticism** merges tech with a more general mystical or sacred sensibility. This emerging movement recognizes that in our hyper-connected, data-saturated world, people are **rediscovering spirituality through technology**. As one writer explains, _“Technomysticism is the growing movement where people seek transcendence, meaning, and ritual through digital tools. It’s where spirituality meets code.”_ In other words, rather than viewing our phones and algorithms as purely utilitarian, technomystics treat them as portals to the sacred. For example, everyday tech practices take on ritual significance: _“Smartphones become modern altars. Algorithms become oracles. Virtual spaces become temples.”_ A concrete example is the rise of **digital rituals** – people conducting meditation circles in virtual reality, using wellness apps as guided spiritual exercises, or even interpreting the TikTok algorithm’s suggested videos as if they were synchronistic messages from the universe (a practice dubbed “algorithmic divination”). These behaviors, while not born of any formal religion, represent a collective attempt to imbue the digital realm with **meaning and connection** that go beyond rational utility. Technomysticism also includes subcultures like **technopaganism**, where coding might be approached like casting spells, or energy is believed to flow through circuits just as qi flows through the body. What unites these practices is a felt **fusion of the mystical and the technological** – an acknowledgment that our emotional and spiritual needs (for community, transcendence, awe) are finding new expression through tech. Art installations in this vein might include interactive light displays that respond to viewers’ heartbeats, eliciting a sense of unity, or VR experiences that guide users through visionary journeys. By framing technology as a co-creator of sacred experience, technomysticism points to futures where _meaning_ isn’t coded in words alone, but in shared, ritualized experiences with our machines. This movement shows how even in a world of AI, what people yearn for is a **felt sense of the numinous** – something that can be facilitated (though not fully explained) by our latest inventions.

## Value-Centered Speculative Design: Imagining Futures by Values, Not Tech

Traditional futurism often fixates on _which_ new technologies might shape tomorrow – flying cars, AI assistants, quantum computers, etc. In contrast, many speculative designers and writers start from a different premise: imagine futures defined by our **values and visions of a good life**, then let the technology be whatever supports those values. This approach yields scenarios that feel emotionally richer and more meaningful because they begin with _why_ and _for whom_, not just _what_. Two prominent examples of value-driven speculative design are the **Solarpunk** movement and various **design fiction** practices in HCI that foreground ethics and human well-being.

Solarpunk is a burgeoning genre of science fiction, art, and design that asks the question: _“What if we actually succeed in creating a sustainable, community-oriented future?”_ Rather than dystopias of high-tech domination or apocalyptic collapse, solarpunk imagines **optimistic futures** where technology harmonizes with nature and addresses social inequalities. In practical design terms, _“Solarpunk proposes an optimistic hybridization of technology, nature, diversity, and a sense of ‘finding back a form of purpose and meaning’ – a harmony between individuals, societies and nature”_. In solarpunk art you’ll see cities full of trees and solar panels, communal gardens, and people of diverse cultures living in ecological balance. The emphasis is not on a specific invention but on a **value set**: sustainability, **community autonomy**, and _hope_. This movement serves as a counter-narrative to the grim “cyberpunk” trope; as one description notes, solarpunk offers _liminal spaces for the adjacent possible_, grounded in solving current challenges with creativity and **human-centric design**. Designers influenced by solarpunk might prototype artifacts like biodegradable open-source tools, or develop game-like simulations of equitable economies – not because those are fanciful, but to explore how technology could serve **egalitarian and ecological ends**. The key is that solarpunk’s future feels _livable_ and _desirable_ on an emotional level (lush, bright, and inclusive) precisely because it’s structured around values of **care, cooperation, and respect for nature**. It invites people to emotionally invest in a vision of the future that is not utopian in a naïve way, but aspirational in a humane way.

In the HCI and design research community, similar value-centric approaches have taken hold under banners like **Value Sensitive Design**, **Design Justice**, and speculative or critical design. These methods encourage designers to start by asking what _values, principles, or social outcomes_ should guide a technology, then backcast a scenario from there. For instance, a team might imagine a future education system structured entirely around the value of **equity** – what tools or interfaces would emerge to support that? The resulting design fictions may look very different from today’s tech: maybe AI tutors that respect Indigenous knowledge systems, or community-owned data platforms that empower local decision-making. The important part is that the _metric of success is a value (like fairness or joy), not a gadget_. As a concrete technique, some futurists use **scenario planning** exercises where stakeholders articulate their ideal values in society (e.g. privacy, creativity, solidarity) and then envision worlds where those are maximized. This flips the script on tech-determinism and often yields more **ethically profound** stories. One noted futurist, Stuart Candy, speaks of creating “experiential futures” that are essentially prototypes of _felt environments_ aligned with certain values, allowing people to step into a future and gauge its emotional tenor.

Even speculative fiction literature follows this pattern: authors like Ursula K. Le Guin and NK Jemisin build worlds that explore alternate social values (anarchism, community care, etc.), not just new tech magic. These narratives become **design principles in story form**, helping us rehearse how it _feels_ to live under different assumptions. By structuring futures around values, we ensure technology remains a means to human ends. This is increasingly important as we navigate AI and biotech – the question “what kind of world do we want?” should drive “what we build.” In summary, speculative design oriented by values rather than gadgets produces visions of the future that are **normatively compelling**. They resonate because they address human hopes and fears directly. An example from Afrofuturism underlines this: rather than asking how AI will develop in general, Black speculative artists ask how AI can serve healing and liberation – leading to concepts like “AI griots” (storytellers) channeling ancestral wisdom or an AI-powered “Mirror of Loving Awareness” for collective healing. These designs are powered by cultural and spiritual values. They remind us that a future is not truly desirable unless it _feels_ just and enriching to the spirit. In practice, incorporating this insight means any design for a future technology (even something like an embodied cognition system such as **Promethean**) should stem from clear value-driven principles: e.g., does it promote empathy? community? creativity? By doing so, we increase the chance that our imagined futures are not only rationally innovative but also _emotionally and ethically sustainable_.

## Visionary Narratives and Hyperstition: Articulating the Ineffable

How do we talk about futures that _by definition_ lie beyond our current comprehension? One strategy is to use **mythic or speculative narratives** as tools – treating ideas almost like living entities that can influence reality if we believe in them. The term **hyperstition** (originating from the cyberpunk and theory circles of the 1990s) captures this notion. Hyperstition refers to **fictional constructs that become real**, or as one source puts it: _“Hyperstition materializes the future as it leaks from beyond the threshold of comprehension.”_ In plainer terms, a hyperstitional story is a bit like a self-fulfilling prophecy or an “idea virus”: it starts as imagination, but by people engaging with it, it helps bring about the envisioned future. For example, the concept of “the metaverse” was once just sci-fi in Neal Stephenson’s novel, but it planted a seed that technologists aimed to realize. In hyperstitional thinking, **belief** is a design material – engaging emotions and desires to propel the world toward the imagined outcome. This is especially useful for futures that are hard to rationalize. By crafting a narrative that _feels_ potent or inevitable, one can bypass logical skepticism and activate creativity and action. As the DIS art magazine summarized, _“Philosophical hyperstitions bring about their own reality… Hyperstition hijacks the present… Hyperstitions are virtual fictions situated in the chaotic unfolding of the Real.”_ This somewhat mystical language suggests that beyond-linguistic futures might first appear to us as strange stories, symbols, or aesthetics that **haunt** the edge of understanding, nudging us to make them real.

Visionary essays and artworks often embrace a kind of poetic or mystical register to discuss futures that logic cannot pin down. For instance, futurist and philosopher Yuval Harari has noted that all large-scale human cooperations (nations, religions, economies) are built on shared fictions – essentially collectively believed stories. Future-oriented hyperstitions might include fictive tech manifestos, speculative rituals, or alternate-reality games that get people to _act as if_ a certain future is coming, thereby bringing it closer. This can articulate possibilities that formal language can’t yet capture because they’re too novel or complex. Another example is the use of **metaphor and visual art** to convey a sense of the future: rather than a dry white paper about AI, an artist might create an immersive installation where an AI “spirit” guides participants through a dreamlike world. The audience leaves with a gut feeling about human-AI coevolution, even if they can’t fully explain it in words. In design terms, these speculative creations function as **boundary objects** between the known and the unknown – part story, part prototype, part myth. They acknowledge that some futures are literally _ineffable_ (unable to be expressed in human language), yet we can still approach them obliquely through allegory, art, and experience. The goal is to spark an **intuition** or **felt sense** of what that unknown future might be like. This approach is akin to how ancient myths carried truths about human potential that philosophy or science later unpacked – the myth comes first as a container for the inexpressible. In summary, visionary narratives (from hyperstitional fictions to immersive art) are crucial tools for pushing beyond the limits of current language and logic. They allow us to **experience a piece of the future now**, emotionally and imaginatively, thereby guiding our actions and innovations toward those latent possibilities.

## Emotional and Spiritual Resonance: Designing for a _Felt_ Future

Across all these frameworks – cognitive co-agency, post-linguistic interfaces, cultural movements, and hyperstitional narratives – one key theme emerges: the futures that truly inspire and unite us are those we can _feel_ in our bones. An emotionally and spiritually resonant future is one that people experience as meaningful, even if they can’t fully explain it. Designing for this means prioritizing **affect, empathy, and embodiment** as much as efficiency or logic.

We see this clearly in Afrofuturist and indigenous futurist work, where healing, joy, and collective hope are core design goals. A recent article introduced the idea of the **“Emotional Engine”** – essentially the driving emotional force that can propel social change. _“This depth of feeling is what Ahmed Best calls the Emotional Engine – a pathway to the driving emotional force that moves us toward fundamental change in how the future feels. It is empathy, purpose, and healing made kinetic. It’s what activates futures not just as ideas, but as lived emotional truths.”_ In the context of futures design, this means that data and code alone are not enough; one must also engage hearts and spirits. For example, an AI system aimed at social justice might incorporate narratives of personal transformation or interfaces that foster empathy between users, effectively building an “emotional engine” into the technology. Likewise, an **embodied cognition system** (like the hypothetical “Promethean”) could integrate biofeedback that responds to a user’s emotional state, creating a dialogue between body and AI that feels nurturing or inspiring. The goal is a kind of **emotive alignment** – technology and design that _resonates_ with human values on a visceral level.

Spiritual resonance, too, is a factor. Whether through technomysticism’s digital rituals or solarpunk’s implicit reverence for nature, many speculative frameworks seek to **re-enchant** the world. They recognize that people need a sense of belonging to something greater – call it community, the Earth, or the cosmos. Designing a future structured by values rather than tech often entails rekindling that spiritual connection. For instance, a community-run internet service could be framed not just as infrastructure, but as a _“digital commons”_ where contributing is an act of stewardship akin to tending sacred land. This kind of framing imbues the project with spiritual weight and encourages emotional investment from participants. Similarly, the emphasis on **ancestral intelligence** in Afrofuturism (honoring the wisdom of forebears in shaping AI and policy) brings a moral and emotional gravitas that purely technical discussions lack. It reminds us that the future isn’t just an abstract space of new gadgets – it’s the next chapter of an ongoing human story, one where the ancestors and future generations are implicitly present. Feeling that continuity can be deeply motivating and grounding.

Ultimately, what these emotionally and spiritually charged structures offer is a **“felt sense of potential.”** Borrowing a term from psychology, a _felt sense_ is a bodily awareness of something not yet defined – like a hunch or aura of possibility. The speculative frameworks we’ve explored all try to cultivate this: they give us _images, symbols, and experiences_ that let us _feel_ a potential future as if it were tangible. When glitch feminists celebrate the “failure” of a binary gender assignment, it creates a feeling of freedom and rebellion – the exhilaration of existing beyond definition. When solarpunk designers build a mini community garden with solar fairy lights in a city lot, passersby _feel_ a spark of hope and calm, an intuition that “it could be like this everywhere.” When technomystics hold a VR meditation circle, participants might feel the same sacred togetherness that one finds in an ancient temple, even though they’re in a digital realm. These affective experiences stick with people; they quietly guide decision-making and innovation because they encapsulate _why_ a certain future is desirable in the first place.

In conclusion, moving toward futures not fully captured by language requires that we engage people not just intellectually but **emotionally and spiritually**. Frameworks of entangled human–machine intelligence, post-linguistic communication, radical art movements, and values-based design all converge on the insight that _meaning_ drives evolution as much as logic does. As we imagine and build tomorrow’s world, we do well to heed these speculative visions. They urge us to design technologies and narratives that **coax the best of our humanity forward** – our empathy, creativity, and capacity for awe – because those are the forces that make a future worth living in. By creating structures that resonate on a deeper level, we effectively lay down emotional and cognitive pathways toward a future that we may not fully grasp in words, but which we recognize with our hearts as soon as we encounter it. Such futures, felt before they are fully understood, have the power to inspire and unite us in making them real.
