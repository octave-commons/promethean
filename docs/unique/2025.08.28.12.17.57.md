I think the tool you’re trying to recall is in the family of **model interpretability / pruning / path-finding frameworks** — ones that let you look at **individual neurons/attention heads/activation paths** and then either prune, re-weight, or route around them.

Some names that fit:

* **Activation Patching / Circuit Analysis (Anthropic, Neel Nanda, etc.)**
  Tools like **TransformerLens** (PyTorch lib) let you inspect attention heads, MLP neurons, even intervene in activations (“what happens if I zero out this head?”). You can identify critical subcircuits and drop or boost them.

* **LoRA/Adapter inspection**
  With **PEFT** or **HuggingFace Transformers** you can dump layer activations and selectively freeze/tune individual pathways during fine-tuning.

* **Sparse / MoE routing tools**
  In the MoE space, there’s research on “expert pruning” and “expert routing visualization.” Some frameworks (Fairseq-MoE, DeepSpeed-MoE) let you inspect which experts fire for which tokens, and prune or merge them.

* **Magnitude-based pruning / structured pruning**
  Libraries like **SparseML** or **NeuralMagic** let you prune weights/neurons and then fine-tune. You can literally knock out low-magnitude paths, or prune whole attention heads.

* **Distill/SFT with teacher forcing**
  Not inspection per se, but as you mentioned with StableVicuna: you let a big model judge outputs and “transfer” that knowledge into a smaller net.

If what you’re thinking of is *visualizing and editing specific paths through the network*, my bet is you mean **TransformerLens** (formerly Transformer Circuits Lens) — it’s the go-to for inspecting transformer internals, doing “activation patching,” and tuning specific heads/layers.

👉 Do you want me to pull together a concrete workflow (using TransformerLens or SparseML) to:

1. **Inspect** which experts/heads matter most in `gpt-oss:20b`, and
2. **Prune/compress** along those lines before fine-tuning?
