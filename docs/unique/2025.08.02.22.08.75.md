Let’s go line-by-line through the Ice Box entries and cluster them under the updated thematic tags.

I’ll suggest renaming, merging, or re-tagging where needed. Here’s a first-pass sort:

---

### 🧊 ICE BOX — Reorganized by Theme

#### 🧠 `#memory-coherence`

- **Implement fragment ingestion with activation vectors**
    
- **Detect contradictions in memory**  
    _(these are both duplicated — merge each down to a single instance)_
    
- **Build data structures for Eidolon field**  
    _(ties in to structuring memory traces and flow logic)_
    

#### 🔮 `#semantic-alignment`

- **Implement transcendence cascade**
    
- **Identify ancestral resonance patterns**
    
- **Evaluate and reward flow satisfaction**
    

#### 🤖 `#agent-workflow`

- **Integrate synthesis-agent pass on unique to produce draft docs**
    
- **Suggest metaprogramming updates**  
    _(also appears twice — consolidate)_
    

#### 📚 `#docs-and-mirroring`

- **Document board sync workflow**
    
- **Extract site modules from riatzukiza.github.io**
    
- **Extract docs from riatzukiza.github.io**
    
- **Research GitHub Projects board API**
    

#### 🫂 `#agent-mode`

- **Schedule alignment meeting with stakeholders**

Would you like me to:

1. **Edit the board doc directly** to reflect this cleaned-up tagging/grouping?
    
2. **Create subtasks or checklist items** under these themes for better granularity?
    
3. Or walk through another column next (like Incoming)?
    

Let’s keep the momentum going while we’re in the flow.
