Ah — so you want a regex that **only matches** things inside a `node_modules` folder.
That way, Obsidian can use it in the "Exclude files" list to filter them out.

For Unix-style `/` paths:

```regex
.*/node_modules/.*  
```

For Windows `\` paths:

```regex
.*\\node_modules\\.*  
```

**Explanation:**

* `.*` → anything before
* `/node_modules/` (or `\\node_modules\\`) → folder name with slashes around it
* `.*` → anything after

This will match:

```
node_modules/foo.js
src/node_modules/bar/index.js
packages/pkg-a/node_modules/pkg-b/file.js
```

And won’t match anything outside `node_modules`.

If your Obsidian vault is cross-platform, you can make it portable:

```regex
.*[\\/]+node_modules[\\/]+.*
```

That matches either `/` or `\` as the path separator.

I can also give you a **faster variant** that doesn’t do as much backtracking if you’re matching huge file lists. Want me to do that?
