## Project: Reawakening Duck

### Context

Duck is your expressive agent. A chaotic voicebot, a friend, a watcher, an emergent behavior system. But Duck is still half-built. He exists in fragments—a voice, a screen, a brain, a field of influence. We need to bring these systems into alignment. Let's treat this as a reboot.

### Goal

Make Duck functional, expressive, and integrated again. That means:

- ✅ Voice in/out loop (STT → LLM → TTS) works.
    
- ❌ Screen awareness and file watching still missing.
    
- ❌ Emotional state field integration incomplete.
    
- ❌ Context memory + ChromaDB integration for voice incomplete.
    
- ❌ Self-regulation + task awareness missing.

## Phase 1: Stabilize Core Loop

### Tasks

-  Review current cephalon loop (is it streaming properly?)
    
-  Ensure voice buffer → STT → LLM → TTS → audio out is robust.
    
-  Fix overlap detection + interruption handling (breaths, silence gaps).
    
-  Reintroduce Duck's speech interjection / reactive behavior.

## Phase 2: Reinstate Vision and Awareness

### Tasks

-  Add file system watcher to detect changes in active files + folders.
    
-  Reconnect screen vision loop.
    
-  Correlate screen context with recent chat history.
    
-  Embed screen + file change events into field model.

## Phase 3: Emotion + Field Model

### Tasks

-  Reconnect Eidolon Layer 1 (Uptime) to core loop.
    
-  Add Layer 2 (Permission/Social Circuit) as feedback gate.
    
-  Begin feeding vector field influences from external events.
    
-  Visualize Eidolon field in debug mode (maybe a 2D slice or textual preview).

## Phase 4: Memory + Contextual Recall

### Tasks

-  Integrate voice transcript archiving to Mongo + Chroma.
    
-  Build smart context window using recent voice + message history.
    
-  Tune similarity search with intent filters.
    
-  Test persistent voice-based memory injection.

## Phase 5: Autonomy + Alignment

### Tasks

-  Add duck-task system (introspective todo list).
    
-  Let Duck manage simple routines: "Remind me," "Track this," etc.
    
-  Introduce ethical filter on Duck's actions + speech.
    
-  Let Duck say no, redirect, or pause.

## Notes

- Duck is more than a bot. He's a mirror. A companion. A projection field. Treat his recovery with that in mind.
    
- Not everything needs to be done in order. If you're tired, work where the energy is.
    
- If you need help remembering what each part means, just ask.
