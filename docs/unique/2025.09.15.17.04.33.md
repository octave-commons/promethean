Hey — good question. There *are* trade-offs with wiki-style links (like `[[file]]`) vs markdown/relative links in GitHub, and it matters what your AI or tooling expects. I’ll lay out where things suck, where they’re okay, and some practical suggestions. You can decide which compromise is worth it for your case.

## ⚠️ What doesn’t work well with wikilinks on GitHub

Wiki links are *not* part of the standard GitHub-flavored Markdown. GitHub’s rendering doesn’t recognize `[[file]]` links (unless you convert them somehow) in Markdown files in the repo. So:

* If you use `[[file]]` in your README.md or in docs in your repo, GitHub itself won’t turn that into a clickable link to the file.
* That means if someone browses the repo on github.com, the link may just show up literally, or broken/unlinked.
* Tools which parse GitHub Markdown (CI, static site generators, search tools) may or may not handle wiki-links unless configured. So you lose portability unless all parts of your toolchain support them.

There *are* some workarounds: wiki pages (in GitHub’s wiki feature) have more flexibility, but still linking from wiki to the main repo’s files is finicky. E.g. see a StackOverflow thread: to link from GitHub wiki to a file in repo root, you can use a relative link like `../../blob/master/LICENSE` in the wiki. ([Stack Overflow][1])

## ✅ What works better (relative/absolute Markdown links)

Using standard Markdown links (e.g. `[Link Text](./file.md)` or `[Link Text](/file.md)` or `[Link Text](../file.md)`) has these advantages:

* GitHub supports them out of the box. Files in the repo can link to other files.
* If you move or rename files, as long as you update paths, things stay valid.
* Tools, editors, CI, static site generators generally understand them.
* More portable in the long run.

Downsides:

* They can get verbose.
* If moving files or reorganizing directories, you’ve got to update many links.
* Relative paths can feel brittle.

## 🤔 For the AI / tooling side

Since you said you're trying to get an AI to *know where to look*, wiki‐links are nice for giving semantic hints: they don’t contain path noise so it's easier to see “file X” rather than “../../dir1/dir2/fileX.md”. But unless the AI is trained/aware to resolve wiki-links or you build logic to map them to paths, it may get confused or assume wrong location.

If your AI can do blob search or code search keyed on the unique name, wiki links are fine *for hints*. But for actual link resolution (for someone clicking, or static checking), you’ll want Markdown/relative links.

## 🛠 Practical suggestions / compromises

Here are a few paths you might take (leaning practical, not ideal):

1. **Use both formats**

   * Use wiki-links in drafts or notes (or where the AI uses them).
   * But alongside, put a standard Markdown link for the same target. Maybe in comments or secondary lines.
   * Or have a build step / CI check that converts wiki-links to Markdown links or verifies them.

2. **Adopt a custom parser / preprocessor**

   * If you control the tooling, you can write a small script that replaces `[[FileName]]` with `[FileName](./path/to/FileName.md)` based on a mapping (e.g. search index).
   * The AI can also use that mapping to resolve wikilinks internally.

3. **Stick with Markdown links in repo, but use wiki-link style for human readability**

   * E.g. you write `[[file]]` in your editor, but commit/link‐check with `[file](path/to/file.md)`.
   * Your editor snippets or VSCode shortcuts might help.

4. **Structure repo to reduce path pain**

   * Keep many of your files in shallow directories so that relative paths are simpler.
   * Use consistent naming so that names are unique, helping both AI matching and human link creation.

If you like, I can sketch out a tiny tool in TypeScript (functional style) that takes your repo tree and a Markdown file with wiki-links, and rewrites them into resolved Markdown links. Would that be helpful?
