  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of torch==2.7.1+cpu and you require torch==2.7.1+cpu, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: `torch` was found on https://pypi.org/simple, but not at the requested version (torch==2.7.1+cpu). A compatible version may be available on a subsequent
      index (e.g., https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu). By default, uv will only consider versions that are published on the first index that contains a given
      package, to avoid dependency confusion attacks. If all indexes are equally trusted, use `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to consider all versions from all
      indexes, regardless of the order in which they were defined.
