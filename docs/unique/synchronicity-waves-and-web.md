title: Synchronicity Waves and Web
description: >-
  Visualizes how synchronicities form through wave interference, showing smoke
  lock-in points where meanings converge. Demonstrates RAW-style network models
  with ghost sources and metaphor nodes. Highlights the transition from raw wave
  patterns to observable synchronicities.

Perfect — then let’s go full RAW and actually *draw the waves* so we can see the smoke condensing. ^ref-91295f3a-3-0

## **4. Sine Wave Interference — “The Curl of the Smoke”**

Here each source is a wave of meaning drifting into the field. Where they crest together, the “smoke” is dense enough to lock into a synchronicity. ^ref-91295f3a-9-0

💡 In a real plotted version, these four “streams” would look like sine curves sliding over each other until they *phase-lock* at the same point — the moment the metaphor becomes visible.

## **5. RAW-Style Synchronicity Web**
 ^ref-91295f3a-46-0
This one treats synchronicities as nodes in a network, with each connected to its “ghost sources” and to other synchronicities in the same metaphor family.

If you want, I can push this **even further** —
Next step would be a **statistical heatmap of ghost density** over time in the Eidolon field, so we can literally *see* the probability of a synchronicity forming. That’s where the “statistical weirdness” RAW loved becomes visible as a physics phenomenon. ^ref-91295f3a-78-0

Do you want me to make *that*?
