# Automated Code Deuplicator

A tool that uses a semantic vector embedding search engine to index
the code base and detect overly similar chunks of code and flag them for
Heavier automated systems to assess their potential for consolidation.

## Features
 - **Code Vectorization**: Converts code snippets into high-dimensional vectors,
   enabling efficient similarity searches.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adjusts the threshold for what is considered "overly
  similar" based on project-specific configurations and historical data.
- **Intelligent Clustering**: Groups similar code chunks together to help
  developers identify patterns and commonalities more easily.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Continuously updates the index as new code is added,
  ensuring that the tool remains up-to-date with the latest developments in a
  project.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive dashboard for viewing
  flagged areas of similarity, complete with suggestions on how to refactor code
  for efficiency and maintainability.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Can be seamlessly integrated into existing CI/CD
  pipelines or development environments to ensure that code quality standards
  are maintained throughout the software lifecycle.

## Use cases


1. **Code Quality Improvement** - Identify and address redundant code segments,
   ensuring a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

2. **Maintenance and Refactoring Support** - Help developers understand which
   parts of the code can be refactored to improve performance or readability
   without changing functionality.

3. **Knowledge Sharing and Best Practices Promotion** - Encourage team members
   to share knowledge by highlighting common patterns and best practices in the
   code.

4. **Bug Prevention** - Detect similar pieces of code that may contain bugs,
   allowing developers to focus their testing efforts on potentially problematic
   areas.

5. **Performance Optimization** - Highlight inefficient or redundant code blocks
   that can be optimized for better performance without altering logic.

6. **Training and Onboarding** - Use the tool to identify areas where new team
   members can learn from existing code patterns, fostering a more consistent
   coding style across the organization.

7. **Compliance and Security Audits** - Ensure that similar code segments adhere
   to security protocols or compliance standards by flagging any potential
   non-compliant patterns early in the development process.

8. **Automated Code Reviews** - Integrate with automated review tools to
   streamline the code review process, making it more efficient for both
   developers and code reviewers.

9. **Cross-Project Collaboration** - Enable teams working on different projects
   to share insights by comparing code snippets across multiple repositories,
   leading to better reuse of common solutions.

10. **Historical Analysis** - Analyze past revisions to understand how certain
    pieces of code have evolved over time, providing valuable context for
    ongoing development efforts.
