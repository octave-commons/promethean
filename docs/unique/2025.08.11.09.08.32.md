# Board Walk – 2025-08-11

**Assumptions**

* WIP limit (global Doing) = **3** (change if you want).
* Doing lanes (for now): **Prompt Refinement**, **Agent Thinking**, **Breakdown**, **In Progress**.
* Aging threshold: **> 2 days** in a Doing lane.

## Blockers

* No items tagged **#blocked** found in the paste.

> If any are blocked, add **#blocked** (and optionally a short reason), e.g., `#blocked:waiting-on-PR-123`.

---

## WIP check (Doing lanes)

* Current **Doing total** (Prompt Refinement + Agent Thinking + Breakdown + In Progress): **14**
* With WIP limit **3**, we’re **over**.

**Proposal**

* Confirm which lanes count as Doing. If all four above are Doing, pull back to **≤3** by:

  1. Moving non‑active cards back to **Ready**.
  2. Splitting any large Doing card into a small slice that can finish in ≤1 day; park the rest in Ready.

---

## Aging WIP (>2 days)

* Not evaluated: timestamps weren’t provided in the paste.

**Recommendation**

* Add `last_touched: YYYY‑MM‑DD` to frontmatter, or let me read file mtimes; then I’ll auto‑flag aging WIP.

---

## Next pull (single)

**Flow goal (stated recently):** extend WS message broker with **queue semantics** and connect services.

* **Best pull (promote from Incoming → Ready):** `[[add_manualack_to_event_bus_and_re_run_tests.md|Add manualAck to event bus and re-run tests]]` (unblocks reliable delivery & retries).
* **If restricted to current Ready only:** `[[Update makefile to have commands specific for agents.md|Update Makefile for agent commands]]` (quick win that improves daily flow) **or** `[[Mirror shared utils with language-specific doc folders.md]]` (reduces duplication before deeper queue work).

> Pick **one**. Everything else waits.

---

## Tag hygiene / normalization

You said you want **column-normalized** hashtags on tasks and files. Proposed canonical set:

* `#ice-box`, `#incoming`, `#accepted`, `#prompt-refinement`, `#agent-thinking`, `#breakdown`, `#ready`, `#todo`, `#in-progress`, `#in-review`, `#done`, `#archive`

**Findings**

* Many **Incoming** items are tagged `#todo`. Suggest adding **`#incoming`** (you can keep `#todo` if you like, but column tag should exist).
* Several **Accepted** items still carry `#todo`.

**Action**

* Run/finish the hashtag-normalizer so each card has both:

  1. the **column tag** (normalized), and
  2. any **status/phase** tag you want (e.g., `#todo`, `#accepted`).

## Quick decisions (checklist)

## Notes / Misc

* **In Progress** is empty—nice. Let’s keep it that way until we explicitly pull the next slice.
* Incoming is **72** items; consider a 10‑minute nightly triage to keep it from ballooning.
