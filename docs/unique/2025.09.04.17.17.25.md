title: Promethean Package Structure
description: >-
  Defines the standard structure for Promethean packages, including required
  files and directories. Each package must have a README, AGENTS.md, a src
  directory with tests and dist subfolders, and a package.json with specific
  build commands. The tsconfig.json ensures TypeScript compilation follows
  project standards.

# Promethean constitution
- Every package in ./packages has a/an:
  - `README.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `src/` which will always contain the following sub folders:
    - `tests`
    - `dist`
  - `package.json`with the commands:
    - `build` compiles the typescript to `dist/`
    - `test` builds the package, then runs tests located in `dist/tests`
    - `clean` removes all build and installation artifacts related to the package.
    - `typecheck` validates the package conforms to the tsconfig files rules.
    - `lint` validates the package meets the projects linting standards
    - `format` Fixes automaticlly fixable issues with lint.
  - `tsconfig.json` A boiler plate tsconfig which
    - **Only** includes `./src/**/*`
    - extends `/config/tsconfig.*.json`
    - sets `rootDir` to `src`
    - sets `outDir` to `dist/`

Packages may also have:
- `static/` files served directly by a file server.
- `src/frontend` Frontend typescript code.
