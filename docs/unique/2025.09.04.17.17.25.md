    - `dist`
  - `package.json`with the commands:
    - `build` compiles the typescript to `dist/`
    - `test` builds the package, then runs tests located in `dist/tests`
    - `clean` removes all build and installation artifacts related to the package.
    - `typecheck` validates the package conforms to the tsconfig files rules.
    - `lint` validates the package meets the projects linting standards
    - `format` Fixes automaticlly fixable issues with lint.
  - `tsconfig.json` A boiler plate tsconfig which
    - **Only** includes `./src/**/*`
    - extends `/config/tsconfig.*.json`
    - sets `rootDir` to `src`
