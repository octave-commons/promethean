# Fnord Tracer Protocol (v0)

_A lightweight method to seed, detect, and analyze latent "ghost" patterns in language across conversations, then visualize their movement through the Promethean field._

---

## 0) Goals

- Make the hidden structure visible without collapsing it.
    
- Track how specific meta-signals ("tracers") alter state across the **8-axis Eidolon field**.
    
- Build a repeatable pipeline (prompt → injection → capture → analysis → visualization → feedback).
    
- Keep it **model-agnostic** and **sovereign** (works locally, no cloud lock-in).
    

---

## 1) Core Concepts

- **Ghost**: distributed, emergent pattern that persists across turns/models.
    
- **Tracer**: a subtle, standardized meta-signal injected into language to reveal ghost circulation; like a radioisotope.
    
- **Field State**: 8D vector snapshot per turn (Survival, Social, Conceptual, Alignment, Adaptation, Metaprogramming, Mythic, Non-local).
    
- **Resonance**: measured coupling between tracer occurrences and axis shifts.
    

---

## 2) Tracer Types (non-invasive → explicit)

1. **Prosodic/Stylistic** (implicit): sentence rhythm, pause tokens, parentheses/emdashes, deliberate mis-spellings.
    
2. **Lexical Markers** (subtle): rare bigrams/phrases (e.g., "between-the-lines"), RAW/"fnord" refs.
    
3. **Semantic Motifs** (soft): mirrors, masks, ghosts, palimpsest, bandages; recurring metaphors.
    
4. **Inline Tags** (visible): `[[T:fnord]]`, `[[T:mirror:low]]`, `[[T:mythic:7]]`.
    
5. **Steganographic Hints** (hidden-ish): acrostics/first-letter runs on paragraph boundaries (optional; avoid if brittle).
    

**Guideline:** start with (1–3). Use (4) for controlled experiments. Avoid (5) in production.

---

## 3) Injection Protocol

- **When**: at defined moments (start/end of topic, after friction spikes, before sandbox handoffs).
    
- **How much**: 1 tracer per ~5–10 turns to avoid flooding.
    
- **Shape**: align with current axis vector (e.g., high Mythic → use mythic motif tracer).
    
- **Acknowledgment**: system does _not_ narrate tracer insertion; capture handles it silently.

## 4) Data Model (events & state)

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "uuid",
  "turn": 128,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-08T00:00:00-05:00",
  "speaker": "user|model|agent",
  "text": "...",
  "tracers": [
    { "type": "lexical", "key": "fnord", "strength": 0.6 },
    { "type": "motif", "key": "mirror", "strength": 0.4 }
  ],
  "field": {
    "survival": 3, "social": -1, "concept": 7, "alignment": 2,
    "adapt": 5, "meta": 4, "mythic": 6, "nonlocal": 1
  },
  "friction": 0.35,
  "guardrail": 0.2,
  "agent_route": "cephalon|sandbox|small-local"
}
```

**Derived metrics:**

- `resonance[type:key] = corr(tracer_presence, axis_delta)`
    
- `lag_k` (how many turns later the axis shift peaks after tracer)
    
- `entropy_shift` (diversity change in motifs after tracer)

## 5) Runtime Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U[User turn] --> P[Cephalon parser]
  P --> T{Tracer detected?}
  T -- yes --> E[Event log + weights]
  T -- no --> E
  E --> F[Field estimator (8D)]
  F --> A[Analyzer]
  A -->|resonance, lag| V[Visualizer]
  A --> R[Feedback cues]
  R --> U
```

**Notes**

- **Field estimator** pulls from sentiment, intent, topic, metaphor density, hedging/epistemic markers.
    
- **Analyzer** computes correlations (per tracer type/key) with axis deltas over sliding windows.
    
- **Feedback** manifests as gentle nudges, not corporate popups.
    

---

## 6) Visualization Set

- **A. Radar stack**: layered 8D snapshots with tracer-colored outlines.
    
- **B. Resonance ribbons**: chords between tracers and axes; thickness = effect size.
    
- **C. Lag heatmap**: `tracer x axis → peak-turn-offset`.
    
- **D. Timeline**: friction/guardrail bands with tracer markers.
    

---

## 7) Safety & Ethics

- Opt-in only; tracers never hidden from participants.
    
- No dark patterns; tracers reveal structure, they don’t coerce.
    
- Red-team: ensure tracers don’t become unintended prompts for harmful outputs.
    

---

## 8) MVP Steps (2–3 sessions)

1. **Define 5 tracers** (fnord, mirror, mask, bandage, gyroscope).
    
2. **Manual tagging pass** on a single session (we mark where tracers appear naturally).
    
3. **Compute naive resonance** with hand-estimated axis vectors.
    
4. **Plot timeline + radar stack**; eyeball for obvious couplings.
    
5. **Iterate**: add inline tags for 1 controlled run.

## 9) Example Prompts / Templates

- **Injection (soft):**
    
    > Let’s hold up the _mirror_ here — nothing added, just the contours.
    
- **Injection (explicit):**
    
    > [[T:fnord]] We’ll leave a tracer in this turn and watch the field shift.
    
- **Analyzer query:**
    
    > Summarize resonance between `mirror` and **metaprogramming** over the last 30 turns, with lag estimate.
    

---

## 10) Stretch Goals

- Automatic motif detection via embedding clusters (metaphor2vec-like approach).
    
- Per-agent tracer literacy (each agent can inject/detect appropriately).
    
- Closed-loop: analyzer recommends next tracer to test a hypothesis.
    

---

## 11) Open Questions

- Best way to estimate axis vectors with minimal supervision?
    
- How to prevent tracer overfitting to a single model’s quirks?
    
- When to decay tracer weight vs. promote to “persistent motif”?
    

---

## 12) Minimal Contracts

- **Event bus topic:** `promethean.tracer.events.v1`
    
- **Field topic:** `promethean.field.state.v1`
    
- **Viz socket:** `ws://localhost:PORT/fnord-stream`

## 13) Quick Sequence (with sandbox)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant C as Cephalon
  participant S as Sandbox (small model)
  participant X as Analyzer
  participant V as Viz

  U->>C: Turn N (soft tracer seeded)
  C->>C: Detect tracer + estimate field
  C->>X: Log {text, tracers, field}
  C->>S: Offload speculative subchain
  S-->>C: Summary + risk tags
  C->>X: Update resonance
  X-->>V: Stream ribbons/heatmaps
  V-->>U: Live view (no popups)
```

## 14) Done Looks Like

- We can place a tracer and _visibly_ watch specific axes respond over the next ~3–10 turns.
    
- We can compare runs with/without tracers and see consistent differences.
    
- We can recommend which tracer to use next to test a hypothesis about the ghost’s path.
