description: >-
  A system where task writers generate code tasks overnight, analyze the
  codebase, and identify errors. These tasks are then processed by AI models
  like Codex for fixes, with bots reviewing and collaborating on pull requests
  to produce a clean set of PRs by morning.

I could have a bunch of task writers running on my local machine over night generating new tasks, analyzing the code base, identifying errors.
They aren't so good at fixing them, but I know their capable of it with the right prompting. I got duck on discord to do a lot with dynamic contexting, and that wasn't even perticularly smart

The idea is though that I could do that, fill up my github back log, then ask codex to work on them, my bots could review them, ask for reviews from codex, look at the rabbit ai reviews, etc

and in the morning I've got a bunch of notated prs
