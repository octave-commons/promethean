# Eidolon Field as Cognitive Physics Substrate

Perfect.

You’re stepping out of the layered schema and into **the medium** itself.

We're talking about the **Eidolon Field** as a _substrate_—not yet bound to circuits or inputs, just a pure **physics of cognition**. Let's define:

---

## 🧊 The Eidolon Field: Abstract Model

At the highest abstraction, it's:

> A multidimensional vector field, continuously updated by **Field Nodes** (sources) and **Particles** (agents), which flow, collide, decay, and interact over time.

It doesn’t care **why** something happened. Only:

- Where is pressure being applied?
    
- What are the flows and gradients?
    
- What mass/velocity/tension does each element have?
    

This lets us **project meaning onto matter** later.

## 🧮 Core Entities

### 🔹 **Field**

A discretized or continuous space that maps locations to vectors (force, flow, potential).

```lisp
(defstruct field
  dimensions     ; number of axes (e.g., 8 for circuits, 2 for RAM vs CPU)
  resolution     ; granularity per axis
  data           ; raw vector values per point
  decay-rate     ; rate of field relaxation over time
  interaction-fn ; governs how new inputs affect the field
)
```

---

### 🔸 **Field Node (Emitter)**

A persistent object that applies a force or potential to the field.

```lisp
(defstruct field-node
  position     ; vecN
  strength     ; scalar or vecN
  influence-fn ; maps time → vector to apply
  id           ; unique name or address
)
```

This could represent:

- A process that always stresses RAM
    
- A permission boundary that repels access
    
- An emotion-like attractor
    

---

### ⚪ **Particle (Agent)**

A transient or mobile object moving through the field.

```lisp
(defstruct field-particle
  position   ; vecN
  velocity   ; vecN
  mass       ; scalar
  drag       ; scalar or fn
  behavior   ; function of local field vector
  decay      ; lifetime or shrinking radius
  id         ; unique agent name
)
```

This could be:

- A speech chunk moving through STT
    
- A fear impulse
    
- A background task slowly drifting to completion

## 🔁 Field Dynamics Engine

Each tick:

1. Decay field vectors slightly
    
2. For each `field-node`, apply its influence to the local field region
    
3. For each `particle`:
    
    - Read field vector at its position
        
    - Update its velocity
        
    - Move it
        
    - Possibly emit new nodes or particles
        
4. Possibly sample output (e.g., compute field entropy, barycenter, hot zones)
    

This creates a **living topology**.

---

## 🧱 Interface: EidolonField API (Abstract)

```js
class EidolonField {
  constructor(dimensions, resolution)

  addNode({ id, position, strength, influenceFn })
  removeNode(id)

  spawnParticle({ id, position, velocity, mass, drag, behaviorFn })

  tick(deltaTime)
  sample(position)
  mapOverParticles(fn)
  projectFromInput(raw) // optional, adds new nodes/particles
}
```

---

## 🌀 Behavior Examples (Domain Agnostic)

- A particle encountering a strong gradient → slows down → turns → circles → decays
    
- A node with decaying influence → emits ripples like a stone in water
    
- Particles cluster near attractors → field self-organizes into “organs”
    
- Dense field zones lead to high entropy → interpreted as panic / overload / noise
    
- Multiple fields can overlap → e.g., “fear” field + “attention” field
    

---

## 🌐 Eidolon as Meta-Fieldspace

Eventually:

- Fields can layer (attention vs fear vs uptime)
    
- Fields can fuse (composite energy field)
    
- Particles can exist in multiple fields (multi-body projection)
    
- Barycenter of a field becomes input to Layer 3
    

But for now: just **field**, **nodes**, and **particles**.

## Next Steps

Would you like to:

- Design the tick/update loop for particles and field interactions?
    
- Define a test field with 2D space and a single attractor node to observe gradients?
    
- Write this as a language-agnostic pseudocode base?
    
- Or start coding it directly (Sibilant or JS preferred)?
