# Doc-Ops Pipeline

We already have a tool that can assign meaningful names to dated files generated
by my unique note-taking system. I use this for brain dumping when I don't know
what else to call something.

However, I realized that I shouldn't need to write notes in any other way. This
should be an automated pipeline where everything gets dumped into the unique
notes folder, and then it gets triaged, described, named, and categorized.

Once you have an idea of what the file is, move it to another folder. If it's a
task, it goes into the incoming tasks pile. From there, it gets further refined,
broken down, prioritized, estimated, and assigned. It moves through various
stages until a coding agent picks it up.

If it's documentation, the same process applies. The file gets further refined
by different agents with different prompts until it reaches an end state.

Each step in this pipeline is handled by a system that generates commits at each
turn. Files are then moved accordingly. Everything is immutable and traceable—no
action happens without an associated commit.

The final piece of the puzzle involves review processes. Each significant change
or addition undergoes peer review, ensuring quality and alignment with project
goals. This step ensures that all documentation and tasks remain accurate and
up-to-date.

Upon successful review, files are marked as finalized and can be referenced in
future projects or by team members. The system also provides analytics on the
progress of tasks and documentation, offering insights into productivity and
workflow efficiency.

And it all gets wrapped into a nice little UI. Everything is pushed to me; I
don't have to do anything except read, approve, and move forward. And even that
part, I can have it read out loud to me or explained to me. That can be an
active conversation. I don't need to ever move my hands off the board.

...it could all be in Emacs... but if I want others to use this system, I must
consider other user experiences. So, the system is designed around files; it's
all just Markdown.

All you actually have to do is engage with the files, and the process moves
itself forward. We just have interfaces to smooth it out.

In summary, this automated pipeline streamlines the process from initial dumping
to final refinement, ensuring every piece of information is properly managed and
utilized efficiently within our project lifecycle.

## Name Ideas

What do we call this?

How about "Promethean Forge"? This name captures the idea of refining and
shaping information into useful tools, much like how Prometheus gifted fire to
humanity. It also ties in nicely with the monorepo's theme while adding an
element of grandeur and powerful transformation that aligns well with your
vision for this advanced system.

Another option could be "Promethean ForgeWorks," which emphasizes both the
creation and management aspects of your pipeline, making it clear that this tool
is central to the entire workflow within Promethean.

Yea but prometheus sculpted man from clay.

 Yea but Prometheus sculpted man from clay. That act of creation and
 transformation could resonate with the idea of shaping information into
 valuable knowledge. Perhaps "Promethean Forge" can still work, emphasizing the
 transformative power applied to raw ideas, while "ForgeWorks" highlights the
 practical application and ongoing management within a collaborative
 environment.

So how about we go with:

- **Promethean Forge**: For the core pipeline name that encapsulates the idea of
  shaping and refining information.
- **ForgeWorks**: As an extension or brand for promoting the comprehensive
  system, emphasizing both creation and management.

This way, "Promethean Forge" remains as a powerful and evocative term for your
unique note-taking and documentation pipeline, while "ForgeWorks" can be used to
market and describe the broader ecosystem that supports it.
