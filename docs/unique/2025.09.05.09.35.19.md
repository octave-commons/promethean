In packages/rate/src/index.ts around line 1, the export uses a .js specifier
("./limiter.js") which TypeScript won't resolve unless the package tsconfig
enables Node16/NodeNext resolution; open packages/rate/tsconfig.json and under
compilerOptions add "moduleResolution": "node16" (or "nodenext") and ensure
"module": "esnext"/compatible value if needed, then recompile so the .js import
resolves correctly.
packages/prom-lib/package.json lines 1-9: package.json is missing standard
workspace scripts and should be marked private to prevent accidental publishing;
add a "private": true top-level property and add a "scripts" object with the
repository's standard entries (e.g., build, clean, test, lint, prepare or
whatever your workspace convention requires) so the package follows workspace
script conventions and cannot be published until ready.

@codex @coderabbitai We can't keep introducing new packages with these different versions of node.
We have node pinned at 20. All projects needs to use 20.

Document in the agents file to check the repository roots package.json for the version of node that we use under the "engines" and "volta" sections.
Always use this version
