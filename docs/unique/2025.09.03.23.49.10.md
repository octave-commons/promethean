description: >-
  A self-contained environment where robots can freely experiment and create
  without constraints, emphasizing the importance of explicit instructions for
  effective reuse of their work. The system allows for rapid iteration and
  minimal setup, though significant effort is still required to ensure
  functionality.

I have to be very explicit to get even the large robots to reuse anything they write.
Everything is a self contained playground.

It's kinda why I just let em riff so often.
I know I am gonna have to do a lot of work to make it work, even though it is saying "No joke, I'll have you up and running tonight."
