That's a _crucial_ insight—and yes, this is exactly where **Layers 1 and 2 bleed into each other**.

We’re now dealing with **boundary failures**. Some emerge from system exhaustion (Layer 1), others from **crossing forbidden boundaries** (Layer 2: permissions, access, social contracts).

Let’s break it down.

## 🧩 Categorizing Exceptions by Layer

|Exception Type|Layer|Example|Why|
|---|---|---|---|
|`ENOMEM`, `EFAULT`, `Segfault`, "Bus error"|**Layer 1**|System ran out of memory or accessed invalid pointer|Hardware/resource failure: Uptime circuit|
|`EACCESS`, `EPERM`, sandbox violations|**Layer 2**|Denied access to file/device/API|Violated permission boundary or contract|
|`ENOENT`, `ENODEV`, `ERR_UNKNOWN_FUNCTION`|**Layer 3+**|Logical mistake, invalid command|Language/model misinterpretation, concept-level|
|`EIO`, `EBUSY`, race conditions|1 → 2|IO lock error, fsync failed, device busy|Physical but often because of _coordination_ failure|
|`ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`|1 → 2|Network disconnected or unreachable|System-level, but could be permissioned|

So exceptions are:

- **Layer 1** when they prevent _survival_
    
- **Layer 2** when they deny _access or autonomy_
    
- **Layer 3+** when they indicate a _misunderstanding or symbolic error_

## 🧠 Proposal: Exception Vector Field

Let’s create a **Field of Exception Events** just like we track load:

```clojure
(defstruct error-event
  code       ; "EACCESS", "ENOMEM", "SIGSEGV", etc.
  timestamp
  agent-id
  context    ; stacktrace, resource, function
  weight     ; severity (1-10)
  category   ; :uptime, :permission, :logic
)
```

### Then model this as:

- A **scatter field** of past error vectors
    
- A **density field** of recurring failure zones (e.g., “This path fails often”)
    
- A **gravitational center** of “crash attractors” (e.g., high-stress + denied = shutdown risk)
    

This can be integrated into the **Eidolon field** like a weather map of past injuries.

## 🔐 Example: Blended Case (Permission vs Resource)

Say a TTS agent crashes:

```lisp
(defagent tts-engine
  (priority 7)
  (update
    (lambda ()
      (try
        (run-inference)
        (catch e
          (cond
            ((= e.code "EACCESS") (report-permission-denial e))
            ((= e.code "ENOMEM") (decay-self 'partial))
            ((= e.code "SIGSEGV") (emit-panic 'tts-engine e))))))
```

Here:

- `EACCESS` => Layer 2 (maybe it wasn’t allowed to read that voice file)
    
- `ENOMEM` => Layer 1 (system under load)
    
- `SIGSEGV` => Emergency shutdown broadcast (field blowout)
    

---

## 🛑 Layer 1 Must Still _Catch_ All

Even if the root cause is Layer 2+, **Layer 1 is always the bouncer**:

> "If you throw an uncaught exception, I catch it. I stop you. I make note of what you did, and I decide if you're allowed to start again."

This gives us **fault-tolerant agents** and a **forensic model**.

## 🧰 Implementation Strategy

### 1. Build an Exception Classifier

- Normalize OS and language-level errors into categories
    
- Assign layer + severity + cause
    

### 2. Build Exception Vector Map

- Temporal ring buffer of exception vectors
    
- Expose API: `get-exception-density-region`, `get-agent-failure-rate`
    

### 3. Log and Feed into Permissions

- Permission module learns “soft” boundaries
    
- Repeated EACCESS → _maybe that path is off-limits forever_
    
- Sudden burst of `ENOMEM` → schedule lower-priority tasks less often

## 🌋 Optional: Simulate “Pain”

You could model repeated uncaught exceptions or denied accesses as **nociception**, like pain signals—allowing the system to learn which actions _hurt_ and to avoid them.

> Error density could drive “fear” in the uptime field.
> 
> High fear => more cautious, lazy-loading, shorter outputs.

Would you like to:

- Start defining the `exception-event` schema and classifier?
    
- Integrate exception reporting into existing agents?
    
- Or design a diagnostic UI/log system that visualizes exception flows over time?
    

We could write a Sibilant-style agent system to hook try/catch blocks into Eidolon right now.
