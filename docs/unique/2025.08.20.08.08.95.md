Good question — you don’t want to risk a bad config soft-locking your session.

There’s no `i3 --check-config` switch (like with `nginx -t`), but i3 actually **does parse and validate configs at startup**. The trick is to point i3 at your config file in a way that doesn’t replace your real session. You’ve got a couple of options:

---

### 1. Use `i3 -C` (check config only)

Run:

```bash
i3 -C -c /path/to/your/config
```

* `-C` tells i3 to check the config and exit.
* `-c` lets you pass an alternate config path.
* If there are errors, they’ll print to stderr. If all’s well, you’ll see nothing or just some info logs.

This is the **safe** way — it doesn’t start a new X session or kill your current one.

---

### 2. Run i3 in a nested X server (sandbox)

If you want to **see** how the config behaves without replacing your WM:

```bash
Xephyr -br -ac -noreset -screen 1280x720 :1 &
DISPLAY=:1 i3 -c /home/err/.config/i3/config
```

* Starts a fresh X server inside a window (`Xephyr`).
* Runs i3 with your config inside that sandbox.
* Lets you test without risking your real session.

---

### 3. Inline validation for automation

If you’re scripting, you can parse logs:

```bash
i3 -C -c /path/to/config 2>&1 | grep ERROR
```

That way you can CI-check your dotfiles before deploying them.

👉 Question for you:
Do you want **just syntax checking** (like `-C` gives you), or do you want to actually **sandbox-run the config** (like with Xephyr) so you can check keybind behavior and window rules too?
