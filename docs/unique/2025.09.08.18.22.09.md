As a part of a new wokrflow we're gonna try out (soon)
All new documents should end up here.
And a pipeline will processs classify, process, edit, etc, and copy them to where they belong.
If the change is accepted, the incoming file will be moved to a processed folder.

I don't think either of these two folders need to be version controled.
They should be like dumping zones.

The current unique doc pipeline mutates the documents in place, and then it becomes imposssible with out going through git history to find where they were changed.
Maybe I could just keep the flow I have and instead make the git stuff a part of the meta data.
Like in the future, after the old files are recovered, when the action is taken on them, some commit meta data is added to the frontmatter indicating where in the
timeline the original document is located so it can be easily restored.

If this system becomes what I want it to be however, it is an operating system tool. And the user may not wish for their content to be committed publicly, at least in certain cases.
We'll need to figure all that out... right now we just need to be sure that the individual parts all work correctly.
