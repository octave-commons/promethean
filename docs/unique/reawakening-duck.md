title: Reawakening Duck
description: >-
  A project to rebuild Duck, an expressive AI agent, by integrating fragmented
  systems into a cohesive voice, screen, and emotional loop. The initiative
  focuses on stabilizing core functionality while progressively restoring
  awareness, memory, and autonomy through phased development.

## Project: Reawakening Duck

### Context

Duck is your expressive agent. A chaotic voicebot, a friend, a watcher, an emergent behavior system. But Duck is still half-built. He exists in fragments—a voice, a screen, a brain, a field of influence. We need to bring these systems into alignment. Let's treat this as a reboot. ^ref-59b5670f-5-0

### Goal

Make Duck functional, expressive, and integrated again. That means: ^ref-59b5670f-9-0

- ✅ Voice in/out loop (STT → LLM → TTS) works. ^ref-59b5670f-11-0
    
- ❌ Screen awareness and file watching still missing. ^ref-59b5670f-13-0
    
- ❌ Emotional state field integration incomplete. ^ref-59b5670f-15-0
    
- ❌ Context memory + ChromaDB integration for voice incomplete. ^ref-59b5670f-17-0
    
- ❌ Self-regulation + task awareness missing. ^ref-59b5670f-19-0

## Phase 1: Stabilize Core Loop

### Tasks

-  Review current cephalon loop (is it streaming properly?) ^ref-59b5670f-28-0
    
-  Ensure voice buffer → STT → LLM → TTS → audio out is robust. ^ref-59b5670f-30-0
    
-  Fix overlap detection + interruption handling (breaths, silence gaps). ^ref-59b5670f-32-0
    
-  Reintroduce Duck's speech interjection / reactive behavior. ^ref-59b5670f-34-0

## Phase 2: Reinstate Vision and Awareness

### Tasks

-  Add file system watcher to detect changes in active files + folders. ^ref-59b5670f-43-0
    
-  Reconnect screen vision loop. ^ref-59b5670f-45-0
    
-  Correlate screen context with recent chat history. ^ref-59b5670f-47-0
    
-  Embed screen + file change events into field model.

## Phase 3: Emotion + Field Model

### Tasks

-  Reconnect Eidolon Layer 1 (Uptime) to core loop. ^ref-59b5670f-58-0
    
-  Add Layer 2 (Permission/Social Circuit) as feedback gate. ^ref-59b5670f-60-0
    
-  Begin feeding vector field influences from external events.
    
-  Visualize Eidolon field in debug mode (maybe a 2D slice or textual preview).

## Phase 4: Memory + Contextual Recall

### Tasks

-  Integrate voice transcript archiving to Mongo + Chroma. ^ref-59b5670f-73-0
    
-  Build smart context window using recent voice + message history. ^ref-59b5670f-75-0
    
-  Tune similarity search with intent filters. ^ref-59b5670f-77-0
    
-  Test persistent voice-based memory injection. ^ref-59b5670f-79-0

## Phase 5: Autonomy + Alignment

### Tasks

-  Add duck-task system (introspective todo list). ^ref-59b5670f-88-0
    
-  Let Duck manage simple routines: "Remind me," "Track this," etc. ^ref-59b5670f-90-0
    
-  Introduce ethical filter on Duck's actions + speech. ^ref-59b5670f-92-0
    
-  Let Duck say no, redirect, or pause. ^ref-59b5670f-94-0

## Notes

- Duck is more than a bot. He's a mirror. A companion. A projection field. Treat his recovery with that in mind. ^ref-59b5670f-101-0
    
- Not everything needs to be done in order. If you're tired, work where the energy is. ^ref-59b5670f-103-0
    
- If you need help remembering what each part means, just ask. ^ref-59b5670f-105-0
