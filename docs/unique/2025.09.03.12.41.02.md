description: >-
  A system where pipelines register with a message bus, and an HTTP server
  connects to this bus to provide interface features. The broker dynamically
  lists available features, enabling procedural UI generation from metadata.
  Kafka can replace the broker for scalability.

I'm thinking about a system where I describe a bunch of pipelines and they all register themselves with a message bus.
There is an http server that is connected to the message bus as well.
The http server registers it's self with the broker
the broker provides it with a list of registered features.

I'm basicly describing MCP. But differently...
Cause MCP is STDIO first...

so no... I'm not... because the features made available through this system are not just for a model.
They are also for an interface.

So we provide an MCP as an interface to this system, and there is also a UI.

The UI can be procedurally generated based on meta data provided by the broker.

Really... we don't even need the HTTP server do we?


I don't even need to define this broker... I should just use kafka...
