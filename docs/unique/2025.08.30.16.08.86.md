So I've gotten something that is better than nothing working for generating new tasks... I don't really like it but... I hate that we have the "windows" problem here.
We have all this tooling *around* obsidian, but we don't have insights into key features of it.
The `executeCommand` and `executeCommandById` are both completely undocumented featues.

Right now the new task template works by callng the chatgpt md plugin after a sleep.

The fact that the smart context thing is not visible in the doucment it's self kinda sucks.
for trying to use it in conjunction with other plugins to generate documents..
