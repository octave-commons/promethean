Alright, so with i3 there isn’t a “desktop environment daemon” to hold your hand — you’ve got to set up Bluetooth the *right* way. Let me break it down:

---

## 1. Make sure the base Bluetooth stack is installed

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install bluez blueman pulseaudio-module-bluetooth
```

* `bluez` → the Linux Bluetooth stack.
* `blueman` → GTK manager for pairing (nice tray app, works well with i3).
* `pulseaudio-module-bluetooth` (or `pipewire-pulse` if you’re on PipeWire) → lets audio devices work.

---

## 2. Enable the Bluetooth service

Check the systemd service:

```bash
systemctl status bluetooth
```

If it’s not running:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth
```

---

## 3. Pick how you want to interact

You’ve got choices here:

* **Terminal only (bare metal):**

  ```bash
  bluetoothctl
  ```

  Inside:

  ```
  power on
  agent on
  default-agent
  scan on
  pair <MAC>
  connect <MAC>
  trust <MAC>
  ```

* **With GUI helper (nicer in i3):**
  Launch `blueman-applet` in the background — it gives you a systray icon.
  Add this line to your `~/.config/i3/config`:

  ```
  exec --no-startup-id blueman-applet
  ```

  (You need a systray bar module like `i3status-rs` / `polybar` / `i3bar` with `tray_output` enabled.)

---

## 4. Audio-specific (Pulse/PipeWire)

After connecting, sometimes the profile defaults to “headset” instead of “A2DP”. You can fix it:

* GUI: `pavucontrol` → Output Devices → switch profile to A2DP.
* CLI:

  ```bash
  pactl list cards short
  pactl set-card-profile <card#> a2dp_sink
  ```

---

## 5. Useful shortcuts in i3

Add to `~/.config/i3/config` for quick toggling:

```i3
# Toggle bluetooth on/off
bindsym $mod+b exec "rfkill toggle bluetooth"

# Launch blueman GUI
bindsym $mod+Shift+b exec blueman-manager
```

---

👉 Question for you: do you want this lean (just `bluetoothctl` in terminal, no daemons beyond `bluetoothd`), or do you want the tray-based workflow (`blueman-applet`) so you can click-pair from i3?

That’ll change what I recommend you actually put in your i3 startup.
