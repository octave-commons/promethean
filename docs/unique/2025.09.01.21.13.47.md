always reinventing the wheel..
don't beat yourself up.
you are free to hack on a thing
if you plan to clean it up when you're done.

Getting one simple usable tool out of all of this would be a nice win right?
something that runs entirely on your system, doesn't depend on the outside world
uses an LLM, and it isn't a toy discord bot.

It's reading your docs, connecting them together, summarizing them, adding meta data, and giving it a meaningful title.
you were asking codex to do this whit mixed results before all the time.
this is a simple, reusable, repeatable, consistant, tool that always does what it is suposed to do.


See?? just ilke that. Isn't that amazing?
All of that chaos, all the strewn around notes.

Now you don't have to think about how you're gonna find them.
this will make it easier.
