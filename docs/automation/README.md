# Automation Docs

Central place for documenting automation workflows in this repo.

## Workflows

- [Lint → Kanban Workflow](./lint-taskgen.md): Convert ESLint errors into Kanban tasks and sync them with the in-repo board.

---

Add more automation-related docs here as we build them out (e.g., test automation, release pipelines, CI/CD flows).
