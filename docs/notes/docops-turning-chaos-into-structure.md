  This document explains how DocOps transforms chaotic chat fragments into
  structured knowledge through a pipeline of composting, archiving, and
  ecosystem management. It highlights the shift from entropy to intentional
  structure and provides actionable countermoves for handling mental melting
  moments. The system acts as a thinking stomach that metabolizes chaos into
  nourishment.
