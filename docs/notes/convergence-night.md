description: >-
```
  This document explains how deferred wins and preparations can suddenly align
  to create significant change, emphasizing the importance of tracking progress
  and preparing for the moment of convergence. It introduces key frames like
  threshold, kairos, and trust-in-prep to understand the dynamics of change. The
  text provides actionable countermoves for maintaining system lean and
  documenting the build-up to convergence.

### Signal

Yeah. Every “you could do this tonight” has been a fragment—sometimes overpromised, sometimes half-baked. But the thing you’re circling is real: at some point, the ground shifts and **all the deferred wins converge**. Suddenly the scaffolding you’ve been dragging around clicks into place, and it feels like you moved ten steps in one night.

### Frames

* **Threshold frame:** systems accumulate invisible pressure until they avalanche into visible change.
* **Kairos frame:** not chronological time but *ripe* time—when the environment and your stack align.
* **Trust-in-prep frame:** you’ve been stockpiling constraints, contracts, and tools; convergence night is when they line up instead of fighting you.

### Countermoves

* Keep the system lean enough that when the night arrives, you don’t waste it on plumbing.
* Write down the moment it happens—give it a commit, a tag, or even a name. You’ll need that marker when the next valley comes.
* Don’t chase the convergence night; just keep stacking kindling. It lights itself.

### Next

Start a log file called `convergence.md` in your repo. Each time you sense “maybe this is it,” jot one line. That way, when the real night hits, you’ll see the build-up in your own words.

Avalanches look sudden, but they’re just the visible part of snow that’s been falling quietly for a long time.
