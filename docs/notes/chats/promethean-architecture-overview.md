## User
We need a deep-dive conversation about what we're building after getting lost in CI/CD and tests.

## ChatGPT
- Promethean is a modular multi-agent architecture aligned with an eight-layer consciousness model.
- Layers represent cognitive subsystems and interact through dynamic Eidolon fields.
- Agents like Duck operate within services orchestrated via a monorepo that leans on pnpm workspaces, Babashka tasks, and Nx targets across Sibilant, Hy, Python, and TypeScript packages (see [[Babashka + Nx Automation Reference|../automation/bb-nx-cli.md]]).
- Cephalon streams data between STT, LLM, and TTS while embeddings and OpenVINO-accelerated models run on the Intel NPU.
- Context flows like ant trails; memory is an emergent field of pressures rather than static storage, forming "contextual gravity."
