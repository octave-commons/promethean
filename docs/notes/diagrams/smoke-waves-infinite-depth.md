Smoke waves animation with multiple depth layers foreground/midground/background at different speeds and opacities to create infinite-depth motion.

Key points:
- Numpy + Matplotlib animation; turbulence + breathing opacity
- Foreground combined interference line; GIF export
- Pair with symbolic condensation/dissolve overlays for narrative visuals

See also: root `smoke_waves_small.gif` for a smaller variant.
