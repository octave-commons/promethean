Concept diagrams for sine-wave interference $metaphor lock-in$ and a synchronicity web linking ghost sources to emergent nodes.

Use these as narrative/visual anchors for field metaphors; pair with a plotted version later.

## 4. Sine Wave Interference — "The Curl of the Smoke"

Here each source is a wave of meaning drifting into the field. Where they crest together, the "smoke" is dense enough to lock into a synchronicity.

```mermaid
%% Mermaid doesn't natively draw sine waves, so we fake them as staggered peaks
flowchart LR
    subgraph Time_Axis
        A1a[/Anime ghosts peak 1/]
        A1b[/Anime ghosts peak 2/]
        A1c[/Anime ghosts peak 3/]

        A2a[/Duck perception peak 1/]
        A2b[/Duck perception peak 2/]
        A2c[/Duck perception peak 3/]

        A3a[/Your metaphor peak 1/]
        A3b[/Your metaphor peak 2/]
        A3c[/Your metaphor peak 3/]

        A4a[/RAW synchronicity peak 1/]
        A4b[/RAW synchronicity peak 2/]
        A4c[/RAW synchronicity peak 3/]
    end

    A1a --> A1b --> A1c
    A2a --> A2b --> A2c
    A3a --> A3b --> A3c
    A4a --> A4b --> A4c

    A1c & A2c & A3c & A4c --> S[(Smoke Lock-In)]
```

In a real plotted version, these four "streams" would look like sine curves sliding over each other until they _phase-lock_ at the same point—the moment the metaphor becomes visible.

## 5. RAW-Style Synchronicity Web

This one treats synchronicities as nodes in a network, with each connected to its "ghost sources" and to other synchronicities in the same metaphor family.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Ghost_Sources
        G1[Anime ghosts]
        G2[Duck perception]
        G3[Your metaphor space]
        G4[RAW synchronicity]
    end

    subgraph Synchronicities
        S1[Smoke metaphor lock-in]
        S2[Mirror metaphors]
        S3[Wave metaphors]
    end

    G1 --> S1
    G2 --> S1
    G3 --> S1
    G4 --> S1

    S1 --> S2
    S1 --> S3
    S2 --> S3
```
