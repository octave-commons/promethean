# Packages Documentation

This directory contains per-package docs. For each `packages/<slug>` there should be a corresponding folder here:

- `docs/packages/<slug>/README.md` — overview, API, diagrams

CI enforces that source changes in a package require docs changes here (or in `docs/services/` / `docs/libraries/` / `docs/apps/`). See `docs/contributing/docs-policy.md`.
