> When your **X (formerly Twitter) account** is connected to ChatGPT, here’s what I can potentially do depending on your permissions and use case (note: some features might still be limited or rolling out):
> 
> ### ✅ Possible Features (Depending on Permissions)

>  - Summarize recent tweets
>  - Find trends or keywords in your feed
>  - Analyze your or others' tweets (sentiment, engagement, etc.)
> 
> 2. **Post tweets for you** (if granted write access)
>  - Draft and publish tweets
>  - Schedule tweets (in some integrations)
>  - Reply to or retweet specific posts
> 
> 3. **Manage your DMs** (if permissions allow)
>  - Draft messages
>  - Help automate responses
>  - Summarize or analyze DM content
> 
> 4. **Analytics & Strategy**

>  - Help develop a posting strategy (timing, tone, hashtags)
> 
> 5. **Content Creation & Curation**
>  - Generate tweet threads or daily tweets

> 
> 6. **Auto-responses / Bots**

>  - Integrate with services like Zapier or Discord
> 
> ### 🔒 What I *don’t* do without explicit permission
> - I don't access or change your data unless you explicitly initiate it.
> - I won’t post, message, or follow/unfollow without direct instruction.
> - I don't collect your private data or keep a persistent connection to your account.
> 
> If you'd like, I can help you verify what specific permissions were granted or guide you in checking/revoking them.
> 
> Would you like to explore any of these capabilities in more detail?
