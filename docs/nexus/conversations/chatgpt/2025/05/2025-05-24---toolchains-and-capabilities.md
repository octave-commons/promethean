> What other toolchains do you have built in like that? That is obviously not in your training data.

> Right—knowing the current date isn't something you'd expect from static training data. That kind of answer comes from what you'd call **built-in toolchains or system-level capabilities**, not the pretrained model itself. Here’s a breakdown of the main categories of built-in tools I can use, depending on your plan and context:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔧 **Built-in Toolchains / Capabilities**
> 
> #### 1. **System Functions**
> - **Current date & time**: I always know it.
> - **Session memory** (optional): If you allow it, I can remember facts between chats (e.g., project goals, coding style, preferred format).
> 
> ---
> 
> #### 2. **Tools for Specific Tasks**
> 
> > Available in **ChatGPT Plus** (GPT-4-turbo, a.k.a. GPT-4.5) and **Pro plans**
> 
> | Tool | What it does |
> |-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | `python` (code interpreter) | Run code (Python, math, plots, file parsing, etc.) |
> | `image_gen` (DALL·E) | Generate or edit images based on your prompt or uploaded images |
> | `web` (browser) | Access **live internet** data for current events, research, prices |
> | `guardian_tool` | Check **U.S. voting info** like deadlines, polling places |
> | `canmore` (Canvas) | Live edit and iterate long documents or code together |
> 
> ---
> 
> #### 3. **Internal Infrastructure**
> These aren’t user-facing tools, but they give me situational awareness:
> - **Context awareness**: I can use things you’ve told me across a session (and across chats if memory is on).
> - **File understanding**: I can look into uploaded files and extract, analyze, or manipulate their contents.
> - **Formatting control**: I can output text, tables, JSON, Markdown, HTML, diagrams, etc.
> 
> ---
> 
> If you're trying to figure out how to leverage these for something complex (like organizing a knowledge base, managing a project, or decentralizing AI safely), I can break down how each tool fits into your stack.
> 
> Want a rundown of which of these are currently available to you based on your plan?
