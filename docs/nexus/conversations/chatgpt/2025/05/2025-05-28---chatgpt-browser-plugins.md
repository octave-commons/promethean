> There are **two main types** of ChatGPT browser plugins or extensions you might be referring to:
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🔌 1. **ChatGPT Browser Extensions (for Chrome, Firefox, etc.)**
> These are **third-party tools** that enhance how you interact with ChatGPT on the web.
> 
> ### 🧠 Examples of Popular Extensions:
> | Extension | Description |
> |----------|-------------|
> | **ChatGPT for Google** | Displays ChatGPT responses alongside Google Search results. |
> | **WebChatGPT** | Adds **real-time web search results** to your ChatGPT prompts (like a primitive browsing mode). |
> | **Merlin** | Adds ChatGPT features to any website (summarizing, answering questions, etc.). |
> | **ChatGPT Prompt Genius** | Lets you save, share, and explore prompts. |
> | **ChatGPT File Uploader Extended** | Allows uploading PDFs and other files for contextual Q&A. |

> ## 🌐 2. **ChatGPT’s Native Web Browsing Feature (Pro Only)**
> This is **built into ChatGPT itself** (only on GPT-4-turbo via Plus/Team/Enterprise plans) and is often referred to as the **"browse with Bing" tool** or **"browsing mode."**
> 
> ### 🔧 How to enable it:
> 1. Go to **Settings > Features**.
> 2. Toggle on **"Browse with Bing"** under tools.
> 3. Switch to **GPT-4** and ensure the "Browse with Bing" option is selected at the top.
> 
> ### 🔍 Use cases:
> - Look up **current news** and events.
> - Access and summarize **specific webpages**.
> - Answer questions about content **beyond the training cutoff**.
>

> 
> ## ⚠️ Security Tip
> Be cautious with third-party browser extensions:
> - Only install from **trusted developers**.
> - Review **permissions** they request.
> - Never give them access to sensitive information.
