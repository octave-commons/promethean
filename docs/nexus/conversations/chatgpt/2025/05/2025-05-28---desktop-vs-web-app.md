> The ChatGPT **desktop app** (available for macOS and Windows) and the **web app** (used through a browser) are mostly feature-equivalent, but the **desktop app offers some unique capabilities and planned advantages**:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ **Current Desktop-Only Features**
> 
> 1. **System-Level File Access** 
>  You can drag and drop or directly upload local files more smoothly. File handling is often faster and more robust than through a browser sandbox.
> 
> 2. **Faster and More Reliable Performance** 
>  The desktop app can use a more stable runtime environment, avoiding browser-related slowdowns, crashes, or memory issues.
> 
> 3. **Dedicated Window and Native UI** 
>  - Stays out of your browser tab clutter.
>  - Can be pinned, set to launch on startup, or placed in your OS's taskbar/dock like any other app.
>  - Supports native keyboard shortcuts (like `Cmd/Ctrl + ,` for settings).
> 
> 4. **Voice Input (via Whisper)** 
>  The desktop app includes built-in voice-to-text using OpenAI’s Whisper, enabling:
>  - Real-time dictation
>  - Natural voice conversations with GPT-4o
> 
> 5. **Quick Access with Global Shortcut** 
>  You can configure a system-wide shortcut to open the app instantly, even over other apps — making it feel like a true assistant.
> 
> 6. **Offline Installations (not offline usage)** 
>  The app can be installed without needing browser support or extensions. While it still requires internet to work, it's easier to deploy across systems for consistent access.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🚧 **Planned / Upcoming Features**
> 
> - **Deeper OS Integration** (future plans):
>  - Clipboard monitoring (e.g., auto-suggest help based on copied text).
>  - Screenshot-to-text or screen-reading capability.
>  - Window-aware contextual help (similar to Copilot in Microsoft 365).
> 
> - **Multi-window support**: Easier context switching between chats or projects.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🚫 **Limitations to Know**
> 
> - No true **offline mode** yet (GPT models still require server-side processing).
> - Fewer browser-specific tools (e.g., bookmarklets, extensions).
> - Currently no plugin/extension framework — unlike browser tools where extensions might extend GPT via third parties.
