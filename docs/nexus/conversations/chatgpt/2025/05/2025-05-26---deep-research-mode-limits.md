> As of May 2025, with a ChatGPT Plus subscription, you have access to the Deep Research feature with the following usage limits:
> 
> - **Standard Deep Research**: 10 tasks per month.
> - **Lightweight Deep Research**: An additional 15 tasks per month after exhausting the standard quota.
> 
> The lightweight version is powered by the o4-mini model, designed to be more cost-efficient while preserving high quality. cite
> 
> Once you reach your limit for the full version, your queries will automatically switch to the lightweight version. cite
> 
> You can check your remaining tasks by hovering over the 'Deep research' button in ChatGPT. cite
> 
> If you find these limits restrictive, upgrading to the Pro plan increases your quotas to 125 tasks per month for both the standard and lightweight versions. cite
> 
> Let me know if you'd like assistance in managing your Deep Research tasks efficiently or exploring alternative research strategies.
