> Help me understand the new projects system. Does it change your behavior or is it just an easier way for me to organize my thoughts?

> Great question! The **new projects system** in ChatGPT (as of mid-2024 and rolling out more broadly in 2025) is mainly designed to make it easier for *you* to organize your thoughts, tasks, documents, and ongoing work inside ChatGPT. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening—and what isn’t—behind the scenes:
> 
> ---
> 
> ## What the Projects System *Does* for You
> 
> - **Organization**: Projects let you group related chats, files, notes, code, and tasks together. Think of it like having folders or workspaces. If you’re running multiple threads (e.g., job applications, an AI project, a game dev sprint), you can keep everything neat and separated.
> - **Persistence**: Each project remembers its own context. So when you come back to a project after days or weeks, your previous chats, files, and notes are still there.
> - **Multi-modal Support**: You can upload files, generate images, run code, and manage documentation, all within a project.
> - **Easy Navigation**: Jump between projects without losing your place or getting topics mixed up.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Does It Change *My* Behavior as ChatGPT?
> 
> ### Not fundamentally—**unless you want it to.**
> 
> - **Context Awareness**: Inside a project, I have better context continuity. I’ll remember more of your prior questions, files, and decisions *within* that project. That means I can tailor advice and follow up on your ongoing tasks more smoothly.
> - **No Cross-Project “Leakage”**: I keep project contexts separate. If you switch projects, I “forget” the details from other projects unless you explicitly bring them up.
> - **More Reliable Memory**: My “short-term memory” (context window) gets a boost, because the system helps keep more relevant stuff loaded for each project.
> - **You’re Still in Control**: I don’t take action or change how I answer unless you want to use a specific workflow, automation, or plugin. My core abilities (coding, summarizing, answering, etc.) stay the same.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## What It **Doesn’t** Do
> 
> - **No Hidden AI Autonomy**: I don’t start managing your projects, auto-moving tasks, or making decisions for you unless you ask for automation (like Kanban boards, reminders, etc.).
> - **No Surveillance**: I don’t “peek” into your other projects. I only know what you share or what’s inside the current project.
> - **No Change to Model Personality**: My tone, expertise, and style are the same—just better at staying “on topic” within each project.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Why Use It?
> 
> - If your workflow spans multiple topics or you want to keep research, experiments, and personal stuff separate, projects are a huge help.
> - If you’re collaborative, you can share a project with teammates, and everyone gets the same organized space (this is rolling out gradually).
> - It’s a lot less messy than searching through dozens of unrelated chats.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### TL;DR
> 
> **It’s mostly about making *your* experience smoother and more organized.** 
> I become a better assistant within each project, but my core capabilities don’t change—unless you explicitly use project features to guide me (like saying “Add this to the Kanban,” or “Summarize my project notes”).
> 
> If you want to get fancy, you can set up workflows, templates, and even lightweight automations—but that’s up to you.
>

> Let me know if you want to see a practical example of how project context improves my help, or if you want tips for organizing your work in the new system!
