> Absolutely—I remember you’re building **Era of Creation** in LÖVE2D with LuaJIT and the Concord ECS framework, and you’ve been fleshing out features like day-night cycles and entity behaviors. 
> 
> Let’s dig into your duck: 
> - **Behavior & AI**: Are you looking to enhance how it navigates the world (e.g., steering, flocking, foraging)? 
> - **Animation & Art**: Do you want smoother sprite animations, wing-flapping cycles, or more frames? 
> - **Physics & Interactions**: Should it respond to water surfaces, collisions, or player interactions in a more realistic way? 
> - **State System**: Perhaps add hunger, sleep, or social states so it goes between wandering, feeding, and resting with the cycle. 
> 
> What aspect of your duck would you like to improve first?
