> Yes, **in most cases**, your Minecraft world will still work when upgrading between **minor versions within the same major release** (e.g., from `1.20.1` to `1.20.4`). Mojang designs these updates to be backward-compatible within the same major version.
> 
> ### Here's what to keep in mind:
> ---
> 
> #### ✅ **Safe to assume compatibility**:
> - **World format stays the same** in minor updates.
> - **Chunks already generated** in your world won’t be affected.
> - **Player inventories, builds, and redstone machines** should behave the same.
> 
> #### ⚠️ **Potential risks**:
> - **Mods or plugins** (e.g., via Forge, Fabric, or Paper) may break between versions, even minor ones. Check for compatibility updates.
> - **World generation changes** (rare in minor updates) will only affect **newly generated chunks**.
> - **Data packs** or **command blocks** using deprecated commands might behave differently.
> 
> #### 🔒 **Backup first anyway**:
> Even if it's a minor update, **always make a backup** of:
> - `/world/`, `/world_nether/`, `/world_the_end/`
> - Any server configuration files
> - Player data
> 
> ### TL;DR:
> If you're running **vanilla** or **lightly-modded** Minecraft and just moving from one `1.20.x` to another `1.20.x`, **your world file should work fine**. Just back it up first, because *"should"* doesn’t mean *"guaranteed"*.

> If I am only changing the minor version of my minecraft server (1.20.x), my world file should still work right?
