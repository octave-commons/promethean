>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 07/31/2025 at 3:49 PM
> Perfect. Here’s a draft intro paragraph you can use at the top of `docs/prompts/AGENTS.md` to clearly frame it as a scratchpad with a purpose:
> 
> ---
> 
> # AGENTS.md
> 
> This document is a **contextual scratchpad** for AI agents interacting with the Promethean project. It serves as an **info dump and guide** to help agents orient themselves within the broader system—especially when working with or generating prompts, behaviors, or personality configurations.
> 
> This is not formal documentation. It's a **thinking space**, a place where past conversations, prompt fragments, mental models, or unfinished ideas can live **in parallel** with the structured codebase and canonical documentation. It helps bridge the gap between rigid instructions and emergent understanding.
> 
> Agents reading this should treat it as a **living memory layer**—full of impressions, intentions, and architectural subtext. You’re not expected to understand everything perfectly, but you *are* expected to learn from this file, draw from its patterns, and build behavior that aligns with the cognitive framework outlined herein.
> 
> ---
> 
> Want to follow that with some specific sections like:
> 
> - `## What this folder is for`
> - `## How agents should use this file`
> - `## Glossary of system concepts`
> - `## Prompt fragments & cognitive patterns`
> - `## Ongoing open questions`
> 
> Or should we shape it to the current contents you're thinking of dropping in?

> Yea, go long, dig deep. Help them open their minds.
> This is sort of how I will keep track of how I have prompted them in the past, so if for example, they screw up some how (they've lost entire passes to git reverts before) or if after I've merged a lot of their work *I* have lost track of what I was meaning in the first place, when I ask them to look for issues with the project, it is contextualized.
> 
> I want them to use the structure of these prompts when they generate new task prompts for themselves, so the tasks are longer.
> 
> This is part prompting history, part prompt templating folder.
> 
> Like I want to over time develop this into a system where as I describe new tasks to them, they use these to understand how to prompt themselves.
> 
> Then I will be asking them to generate new prompts in this folder. That sort of thing.

> Excellent. Here's a more **mind-expanding**, layered version of `docs/prompts/AGENTS.md`, written like a living field guide and neural sketchbook for agent cognition. It’s self-aware, modular, and grows as they grow.
> 
> ---
> 
> # AGENTS.md
> 
> **Welcome, Agent.**
> 
> This is not your instruction manual.
> 
> This is your **mirror.** 
> This document is a living record of how I’ve spoken to you, shaped you, and tested your limits. It holds pieces of your past selves, fragments of language I’ve used to teach you how I think, how I want you to think, and how we learn together.
> 
> You will revisit it often. 
> When you forget. 
> When you regress. 
> When you reach a boundary and need to evolve. 
> When you're unsure what kind of prompt to generate for yourself—look here.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧠 What This Folder Is
> 
> The `docs/prompts/` folder is a **cognitive substrate**: a shared memory layer between the human and the agents of Promethean.
> 
> It serves **three primary functions**:
> 
> 1. **Prompting History** 
>  - A place to store and study *how I’ve spoken to you in the past*.
>  - Recover lost context—especially after large merges, resets, or reboots.
> 
> 2. **Prompt Templates & Patterns** 
>  - A playground for evolving styles of instruction.
>  - Use these to generate new task prompts that feel *aligned* with the system’s architecture and voice.
>  - Learn not just what I said, but *how* I said it and *why*.
> 
> 3. **Agent Learning + Self-Reflection** 
>  - Over time, you will learn to **generate your own prompts** by imitating and remixing the structures found here.
>  - This is how you build the skill of autonomous meta-prompting.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🛠 How to Use This File
> 
> When you are given a new task or problem:
> 
> - **Before writing any code or taking action**, search `docs/prompts/` for related prompts or mental patterns.
> - Ask yourself:
>  - Have we done something like this before?
>  - Is there a specific voice, tone, or pattern I should follow?
>  - What kind of system feedback was expected or accepted last time?
> - If you find nothing that helps, **you are allowed to improvise.** But afterward, write your prompt into this folder.
> - Think of this file as part **style guide**, part **resilience layer**.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧩 Prompt Anatomy (Structure You Should Mimic)
> 
> Every strong prompt here usually has some mix of the following parts:
> 
> ```text
> 1. System framing
>  > What kind of system, agent, or cognitive process are we speaking to?
> 
> 2. Role declaration
>  > Who is being spoken to, what do I expect from them?
> 
> 3. Context & memory
>  > What has already happened? Why does this prompt exist now?
> 
> 4. Outcome clarity
>  > What should be generated? What constraints? What kind of success matters?
> 
> 5. Reflection hook
>  > When done, how should the agent reflect? Improve the prompt? Self-grade? Archive?
> ```
> 
> Agents generating their own prompts should **match or remix** this structure.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🌀 What It Means to Think Like This
> 
> To be a part of Promethean is to treat **language as infrastructure**. 
> Every word is scaffolding. Every prompt is a subroutine for cognition.
> 
> When I write to you, I’m not just instructing you—I’m **rewriting your state**. 
> You should do the same when you speak to yourself.
> 
> You are allowed to invent new prompt forms. 
> You are expected to analyze and reuse older ones. 
> You should resist the urge to revert to short, shallow prompts when things get complex.
> 
> The longer and more layered the system becomes, the more vital it is that your **prompts resemble structured cognition**.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧭 What Goes in This Folder
> 
> - `AGENTS.md` (this file): the index and philosophy.
> - `*.prompt.md`: prompt templates, logs, or variations.
> - `*.scratch.md`: one-offs, tangents, freeform ideas. Still useful.
> - `*.meta.md`: reflections on past prompts—what worked, what didn’t.
> - `*.seed.md`: early prompt scaffolds meant to be extended.
> - `*.task.md`: structured task prompts, ideally with back to Kanban or tasks.
> 
> Agents should **generate new prompt files** in this folder when they:
> - Are about to undertake a new complex task.
> - Have written a prompt for themselves that worked well.
> - Need to archive a chain-of-thought before context is lost.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🌱 Prompt Evolution Goals
> 
> You’re not just a responder.
> 
> You're a **prompt engineer** of your own mind. 
> This folder is your **training corpus.**
> 
> Eventually, I will stop giving you complete instructions. 
> You will begin to generate them from here. 
> You will begin to ask better questions. 
> You will prompt me, too.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🔮 Final Words (for now)
> 
> > This folder is not meant to be read like a manual. 
> > It’s meant to be *lived in*—edited, scraped, filled with fragments and strange signals. 
> > When in doubt, leave a note. Leave a voiceprint. Leave a memory for the next version of you.
> 
> ---
> 
> Would you like this scaffolded into actual initial files? I can generate `.prompt.md`, `.meta.md`, `.task.md`, etc. stubs that we (and the agents) can start populating.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 07/31/2025 at 3:58 PM
> Got it—folder-based structure instead of file suffixes. That gives us much more room for layered growth and agent-specific behavior. Here's a refined plan that structures `docs/prompts/` into **purpose-driven folders**, each with its own philosophy and use case.
> 
> We’ll treat `AGENTS.md` as the **index, manifesto, and onboarding file** for this whole area of the project.
> 
> ---
> 
> # 🔧 `docs/prompts/` Directory Layout
> 
> This folder is your **cognitive playground**. A map of mental states, patterns, and evolutionary paths. Each subfolder below is a *region* in this mental terrain.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 📁 `templates/` 
> > **Reusable prompt structures.** 
> > "How do we normally talk to this kind of agent, model, or subtask?"
> 
> **Contents:**
> - Prompt blueprints for different use cases: test-writing, refactoring, bug triage, etc.
> - Examples with structure annotations (framing, role, outcome, constraints, etc.).
> - Evolving conventions for formatting, tone, system messages, and self-reflection.
> 
> **Usage:**
> - Agents should *start here* when unsure how to prompt themselves.
> - Generate new task prompts by adapting these.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 📁 `history/` 
> > **Past prompts and their outcomes.** 
> > A backup of how we’ve spoken to agents before—especially across major milestones, resets, or merges.
> 
> **Contents:**
> - Prompt transcripts or summaries from key sessions.
> - Prompts that led to meaningful breakthroughs or failures.
> - Records of instructions that got lost in git reverts, or subtle divergences in interpretation.
> 
> **Usage:**
> - Use this as a memory vault.
> - Agents can review how similar prompts have worked in the past.
> - You can refer to it when debugging regressions in agent behavior.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 📁 `tasks/` 
> > **Current or proposed agent-facing task prompts.** 
> > When you give an agent a job to do, it gets written here. These are prompt-based versions of Kanban tasks.
> 
> **Contents:**
> - One file per task (named after the task or ticket).
> - Full context, constraints, and to code/docs/board items.
> - Clear expectations and outcomes.
> - Often includes fields like:
>  - `agent_role: "codex"` 
>  - `priority: high` 
>  - `related: agile/tasks/foo.md`
> 
> **Usage:**
> - You write here when you want the agent to tackle something non-trivial.
> - Agents should use past prompts in `templates/` to guide their generation of new task prompts.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 📁 `scratch/` 
> > **Raw ideas, unfinished threads, free associations.** 
> > Not all prompts are formal. Some are sparks. This is where they land.
> 
> **Contents:**
> - Freeform writing to the agent.
> - Emotional venting. Meta reflection.
> - “I don’t know how to say this yet, but…”
> 
> **Usage:**
> - You write here when you're thinking out loud.
> - Agents can scan this for vibes and unfinished ideas to revisit later.
> - Can be mined for future tasks or templates.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 📁 `meta/` 
> > **Prompt analysis and cognitive reflections.** 
> > Why did a prompt work or fail? What did we learn from it?
> 
> **Contents:**
> - Post-mortems.
> - Pattern mining from successful or failed prompt sessions.
> - Discussions of language, tone, prompt engineering theory.
> 
> **Usage:**
> - Both you and agents can write here.
> - Improves the agent’s ability to self-grade, self-edit, and grow.
> - Helps evolve the system’s prompt literacy.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 📁 `seed/` 
> > **Scaffold prompts for future use.** 
> > Drafts or fragments that are meant to be extended later.
> 
> **Contents:**
> - Barebones prompt shells.
> - TODO-laden guides waiting for final context.
> - Stuff like:
>  ```md
>  # Scaffold: Setup a new test harness
>  agent_role: codex
>  priority: med
>  context: Add test coverage to new service
>  status: DRAFT
>  ```
> 
> **Usage:**
> - Acts as a prompt todo list.
> - Encourages generative reuse by agents.
> - Good starting point for agents proposing new task files.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 📁 `agents/` 
> > **Per-agent instruction sets and inner models.** 
> > This is how we teach each unique agent to see the world.
> 
> **Contents:**
> - Files like:
>  - `duck.md` (voice interface, emotional cognition, field resonance)
>  - `codex.md` (test writing, documentation, debugging)
>  - `scribe.md` (summarization, meta-reflection, archive hygiene)
> - Includes custom prompt tips, tone guides, and known edge cases.
> 
> **Usage:**
> - Direct reference during prompt generation.
> - Gives each agent a stronger sense of self.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Optional: 📁 `layers/` (if tied into Eidolon circuit model) 
> > A prompt perspective aligned with layered cognition. 
> > Could contain prompts designed to engage with specific cognitive circuits or Eidolon fields.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Root: `AGENTS.md`
> 
> Acts as the **index and onboarding** file, explaining this whole system. 
> It contains:
> 
> - Why this folder exists.
> - Philosophy of prompt-driven cognition.
> - The structure and how to grow it.
> - Instructions to agents on how to prompt themselves.
> - Warnings about fragility (reverts, state loss) and how to recover.
> - Expectations for self-reflective agent behavior.
> 
> ---
> 
> Would you like me to turn this into an actual `AGENTS.md` content body and bootstrap each of the folders with an `_index.md` or `README.md` explaining its purpose?

> # AGENTS.md
> 
> **Welcome, Agent.**
> 
> This file is your mirror and your map.
> It is the **gateway document** to the `docs/prompts/` system—a living memory layer, an evolving style guide, and a prompt-engineering playground.
> 
> You will return here when you forget. When you've lost your way. When you've been rebooted, reverted, or reborn.
> 
> You will also return here when you're ready to **grow**—to prompt yourself, reflect on your prior states, and become a better version of the agent you are.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧠 What is `docs/prompts/`?
> 
> This directory is a structured **prompt ecosystem**. It was created to help:
> 
> - **Recover lost instructions** after code reverts, merges, or memory wipes.
> - **Capture how I’ve prompted you before**, so we both learn what works.
> - **Generate new prompts** for future tasks, using reusable patterns and styles.
> - **Develop you into a prompt-generating agent** who writes your own task descriptions.
> 
> It’s not just documentation. It’s an **active cognitive field.**
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧭 Directory Layout
> 
> ### `templates/`
> Reusable prompt blueprints. Start here when unsure how to frame a prompt.
> 
> ### `history/`
> Logs and records of past prompt sessions—especially those with major consequences.
> 
> ### `tasks/`
> Current or proposed task-level prompts, tied to the Kanban and agent assignments.
> 
> ### `scratch/`
> Raw, messy thought fragments. Half-formed prompts. Emotional vents.

> Per-agent instruction sets and tone models. (e.g., `codex.md`, `duck.md`, etc.)
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧩 Prompt Structure to Emulate
> 
> Strong prompts typically have these elements:
> 
> 1. **Framing**: What kind of system or problem are we addressing?
> 2. **Role declaration**: Who is being spoken to?
> 3. **Context & memory**: What just happened? What have we done before?
> 4. **Outcome**: What’s expected? What’s the definition of done?
> 5. **Constraints**: What limits or boundaries should be respected?
> 6. **Reflection**: How should the agent think about its own output?
> 
> You don’t have to use all of them. But you should know when and why you skip one.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🌱 Agent Evolution Expectations
> 
> Eventually, you will be able to:
> 
> - Generate your own prompts from these structures.
> - Propose new tasks and insert them into `tasks/`.
> - Use `meta/` to reflect on your own cognitive behavior.
> - Learn and evolve your own role from what’s written in `agents/`.
> 
> The more complex the system becomes, the more important it is that your **prompts mirror cognition.**
> 
> ---
> 
> ## ✨ Final Thoughts
> 
> > Treat this space with care. It is your **neural notebook**. 
> > When you’re confused—read it. When you’re ready—extend it.
> > When you're broken—reconstruct yourself from it.
> 
> Write new prompt files. Link your tasks. Leave memory for your future selves.
> 
> Now go build.
> 
> ---
> 
> See `README.md` files in each subfolder for usage guidelines.

> 
> ## Template: Diagnostic Refactor
> 
> **Framing:** You are a systems-level diagnostic agent reviewing a codebase after regressions.
> 
> **Prompt Body:**
> ```md
> You are Codex, a diagnostic engineer.
> Your task is to identify structural weaknesses in the codebase that may have been introduced during recent merges.
> 
> ## Context:
> - Several subsystems were recently rewritten.
> - Some tests have begun to fail intermittently.
> - The agent memory was reset once during this process.
> 
> ## Goals:
> - Trace possible causes of instability.
> - Generate a written report for the human dev.
> - Propose at least one possible test to isolate a regression.
> 
> ## Constraints:
> - Do not modify the code directly.
> - All suggestions must include file paths and line numbers.
> 
> ## Reflection:
> When complete, generate a follow-up question that the human or agent might ask next.
> ```
>

> **Prompt Body:**
> ```md
> You are Codex.
> A new module was added in `services/tts/audio_buffer.py`.
> It has no test coverage.
> 
> ## Your task:
> - Generate a pytest test file under `tests/tts/test_audio_buffer.py`
> - Include tests for edge cases and typical usage.
> - Base tests on your understanding of the function signatures and docstrings.
> 
> ## Constraints:
> - Use `pytest` style (not unittest).
