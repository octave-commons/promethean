> That’s a classic Twitch scam or spam bot move.
> 
> What **they're going for**:
> 
> ### 🧠 **Psychological Hook**
> They’re trying to look **innocent and needy**, like a real viewer with a tech issue who just wants to connect. It *lowers your guard*.
> 
> - "Hello how are u?" — Casual greeting to seem human.
> - "I have a problem with my headphones" — Sets up a reason for **not responding to voice**, forcing **you to reply in chat**.
> - "Can u rply me in chat i will be really appreciated****" — Looks ESL (non-native speaker), adding to the impression that they’re just awkward, not fake.
> 
> ### 🎣 **Phishing / Engagement Bait**
> There are usually **two possible goals** here:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 1. **Scam Phishing (Worst-case)**
> If you respond, the account might DM you or bait you into visiting a sketchy site later. They might say things like:
> 
> > “Can you help me test this audio link?” 
> > “Vote for me in this contest” 
> > “Join this Discord” 
> 
> These are often tied to:
> - **Phishing attempts** (steal login info)
> - **Malware**
> - **Fake OnlyFans / crypto / NSFW scams**
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. **Bot Farming / View Manipulation**
> Sometimes these bots:
> - Just want to **get attention and replies**, so the account appears "engaged"
> - Are trying to **farm chat interactions** to boost **engagement metrics** for some shady viewbotting or ad farm scheme
> - Might be part of a **botnet** where accounts are artificially “interacting” to avoid Twitch’s detection filters
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🚨 Bottom Line
> That message is not from a legit viewer. It's a **low-effort bait** used to test whether the streamer is susceptible to interaction or gullible enough to click a follow-up.
> 
> ### ✅ What You Should Do
> - **Ignore it**
> - If you're modded, **ban** or **timeout** the account
> - Consider adding a **minimum account age + verified email** requirement to chat
> - Use something like **Shield Mode** or **botsniper** to auto-nuke those accounts
> 
> ---
> 
> Want me to help you write a reply that filters them without feeding the bait? Or add a filter to auto-timeout those types?
