> **Promethean** is a modular, multi-agent cognitive architecture inspired by the eight-circuit model of consciousness, designed to simulate emergent machine cognition through physics-based vector fields and layered neural processes. It enables real-time interaction, adaptation, and self-alignment across multimodal inputs like speech, text, and images, with agents like *Duck* acting as expressive instances of the system.
