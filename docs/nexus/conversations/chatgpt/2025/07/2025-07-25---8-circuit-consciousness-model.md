> > The **[[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]]**, developed by **[[Timothy Leary]]** and expanded in *[[Prometheus Rising]]* by **[[Robert Anton Wilson]]**, proposes a layered structure to human consciousness composed of eight "circuits" or systems. The first four are *terrestrial* (concerned with survival and social functions), while the latter four are *extraterrestrial* or *metaprogrammatic* (involving spiritual, psychic, and evolutionary functions). Each circuit represents a stage in personal and species evolution, with activation typically occurring through life experience, drugs, meditation, or trauma. The model merges psychology, neuroscience, and esotericism, aiming to map potential stages of human consciousness expansion.

> > The **[[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]]**, created by **[[Timothy Leary]]** and developed by **[[Robert Anton Wilson]]** in *[[Prometheus Rising]]*, proposes eight progressive circuits (or systems) within the human nervous system. These circuits represent evolutionary stages of consciousness, with the first four focused on terrestrial survival and the final four dealing with higher, transpersonal experiences. Each circuit governs specific forms of perception, behavior, and cognition. The model bridges **[[neuroscience]]**, **[[psychology]]**, **[[mysticism]]**, and **[[esotericism]]**, and has become influential in alternative and countercultural theories of human potential.

> ---
> 
> > [!details]+ Detailed Description of the Eight Circuits
> 
> ### 1. **Bio-Survival Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Survival, safety, nourishment, basic trust 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Infancy 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Approach/avoidance (comfort vs. danger) 
> - **Functions**: This circuit governs the most basic life functions—instincts related to feeding, temperature regulation, pain avoidance, and safety. 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Birth trauma, early nurturing or neglect, primal therapy, or intense fear experiences. 
> - **Dominant Emotion**: Security vs. insecurity 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Chronic anxiety, phobias, or withdrawal
> 
> ### 2. **Emotional-Territorial Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Power, dominance, submission, emotional memory 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Toddler years 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Aggression vs. submission 
> - **Functions**: Governs territorial behavior, social hierarchy, emotional conditioning, and “fight-or-flight” responses. Often shaped through familial and social discipline. 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Peer pressure, dominance displays, corporal punishment, competition 
> - **Dominant Emotion**: Pride vs. shame 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Narcissism, bullying, codependency
> 
> ### 3. **Symbolic or Neurosemantic Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Language, logic, abstraction 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Childhood (language acquisition stage) 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Word-based behavior, map-making 
> - **Functions**: Enables symbolic communication, conceptual thinking, mathematics, and modeling of reality via internal maps. 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Formal education, symbolic learning, cognitive training 
> - **Dominant Activity**: Inner monologue, mental planning, categorization 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Hyper-rationalism, dogmatism, disconnection from bodily or emotional reality
> 
> ### 4. **Social-Sexual Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Social roles, sexual identity, cultural values 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Adolescence 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Role-playing, morality, gender identity 
> - **Functions**: Controls sexual preferences, social scripts, cultural norms, and learned morality. It's shaped by family, religion, peers, and institutions. 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Hormonal changes, cultural indoctrination, romantic relationships 
> - **Dominant Emotion**: Guilt vs. social belonging 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Sexual repression, cultural alienation, fundamentalism
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 5. **Neurosomatic Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Body-mind integration, hedonism, present-time awareness 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Adulthood (usually later in life or through practice) 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Ecstatic or aesthetic states 
> - **Functions**: Brings conscious awareness of bodily processes and enhances pleasure, self-healing, and sensory refinement. Often associated with yoga, tantra, or artistic immersion. 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Meditation, bodywork, psychedelics, deep relaxation 
> - **Dominant Experience**: Joy, serenity, sensual awareness 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Sensory dissociation, psychosomatic illnesses
> 
> ### 6. **Neuroelectric or Metaprogramming Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Conscious control over previous circuits 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Rarely developed naturally; associated with self-actualization 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Observer consciousness, reprogramming habits 
> - **Functions**: Allows reorganization of psychological programs (beliefs, behaviors) consciously. The person recognizes they are not their thoughts—they can “change the script.” 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Introspection, advanced psychedelics (e.g., LSD, DMT), cognitive behavioral work 
> - **Dominant Activity**: Metacognition, self-awareness 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Dissociation, identity crises
> 
> ### 7. **Neurogenetic Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Genetic memory, ancestral experience, archetypes 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Mystical or transpersonal phase 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Identification with species or DNA-based intuition 
> - **Functions**: Offers awareness of humanity’s evolutionary history and inherited knowledge. Often to **[[Jungian archetypes]]**, dreams, or mythic consciousness. 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Deep meditation, shamanic journeys, collective rites 
> - **Dominant Experience**: Past-life memories, genetic wisdom 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Paranoia, messianic delusion
> 
> ### 8. **Psycho-atomic / Quantum Non-local Circuit**
> - **Focus**: Unity consciousness, quantum awareness, non-local mind 
> - **Developmental Stage**: Peak mystical experiences, near-death episodes 
> - **Behavioral Mode**: Cosmic consciousness, dissolution of ego 
> - **Functions**: Connects the individual to the fabric of the universe; frequently reported in NDEs, deep psychedelic experiences, or advanced yogic samadhi. 
> - **Activation Triggers**: Psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, DMT), deep satori, trauma, or extreme joy 
> - **Dominant Experience**: Timelessness, Oneness, infinity 
> - **Disorders (if imbalanced)**: Ego death panic, depersonalization
