> Based on the information you provided—“In‑network Insurances: Aetna, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Cigna, Multiplan, United Healthcare” in Iowa and Minnesota—**Medicaid is *not* listed**. That typically means this doctor **does *not* accept Medicaid**.
> 
> **Practical next steps:**
> 1. **Contact the clinic directly** and ask: 
>  _“Do you accept Medicaid? If so, which plans?”_ — they may participate under a different umbrella (e.g. managed Medicaid through one of the listed payers).
> 2. Alternatively, check your **state Medicaid provider directory** online: 
>  - Iowa Medicaid Provider Directory 
>  - Minnesota Medicaid (Medical Assistance) Provider Directory 
> 3. If available, ask your Medicaid plan for a list of in-network providers in that specialty and location.
> 
> It’s not uncommon for a doctor to participate in some Medicaid plans via managed-care arrangements labeled under broader insurers. But if Medicaid capacity isn’t explicit in their published in-network list, assume they **probably don’t accept it**.
> 
> 🤔 **Bottom line:** Based on the network list you shared, Medicaid doesn’t appear to be accepted. Contacting the provider or checking state directories is your next best move. Let me know if you’d like assistance finding those directories.
