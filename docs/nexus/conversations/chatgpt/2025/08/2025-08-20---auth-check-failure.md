> ⚠️ Auth check failed: the SmartGPT Bridge returned **`unauthorized`**. 
> This means you’re not currently authenticated with the endpoint at `err-stealth-16-ai-studio-a1vgg.tailbe888a.ts.net`.
> 
> Next steps you might take:
> - Confirm you have valid credentials or API key configured. 
> - Check whether your session has expired and needs re-auth. 
> - If there’s an auth proxy or guard in front of the endpoint, refresh or log in again. 
> 
> Do you want me to show you the expected **auth flow** (payload + curl example) so you can retry?
