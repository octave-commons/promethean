> Short answer: **maybe**, but it hinges on rules that are annoyingly specific.
> 
> ### The reality
> - **Mailing a Schedule II med (Vyvanse) is legal** for a **DEA-registered pharmacy** to do, including across state lines, as long as there’s a valid prescription. USPS explicitly allows pharmacists/clinicians to mail prescriptions; you (or family) can’t legally mail it yourself. cite 
> - **Medicaid is state-by-state.** Your home-state Medicaid generally won’t pay an out-of-state pharmacy **unless** that pharmacy is enrolled with your state’s Medicaid (some states also allow a few “border” or nonresident pharmacies). Routine meds while you’re temporarily in another state are often **not covered** unless these conditions are met. cite 
> - **Pharmacy licensing matters.** To ship into your winter state, the dispensing pharmacy typically must hold a **nonresident (mail-order) pharmacy license** in that destination state. Many mail-order/national chains have these, but not all. cite 
> - **Schedule II logistics:** no refills, but your prescriber may issue **multiple sequential e-prescriptions** totaling up to **90 days** with “do not fill before” dates; and since 2023, an **electronic** Schedule II prescription can be **transferred once** between pharmacies (state law permitting). Partial fills can be allowed, but you can’t transfer the remainder elsewhere. cite
> 
> ### What to do (practical, minimal friction)
> 1. **Call your plan’s Member Services** (on your Medicaid card). Ask: 
>  “Which **in-network mail-order pharmacies** for my plan can **ship to [winter state]**? Are they **enrolled with [home state] Medicaid** and licensed to ship to [winter state]?” 
>  If they say “use X,” get that pharmacy’s info and enrollment confirmed. Many plans list a preferred mail-order option. cite
> 2. **Loop in your prescriber** now. Ask them to: 
>  - Send **EPCS** to the approved mail-order pharmacy. 
>  - If you’ll be gone awhile, issue **sequential Schedule II scripts** (up to 90 days total) with proper “earliest fill” dates—**if your plan/state allows** that day-supply for stimulants. cite
> 3. **Confirm the pharmacy is licensed** in your winter state (they usually are if they say they can ship there) and ask whether **adult-signature** is required on delivery. cite
> 4. **If your plan won’t cover out-of-state shipping:** 
>  - Option A: **Fill before you travel** using sequential prescriptions to cover the winter period. cite 
>  - Option B: If you truly **reside** in the winter state for the season, consider **switching Medicaid residency** (you can’t be enrolled in two states). This is bureaucracy, but it’s the clean/legal path if you’re there long enough. cite 
>  - Avoid “have a friend pick it up and mail it”—that’s **illegal** for controlled meds. cite
> 
> ### Bottom line
> Yes, you *can* often get Vyvanse mailed to your winter address **if** you use a mail-order or chain pharmacy that’s (1) **in-network with your home-state Medicaid**, and (2) **licensed to ship** to your winter state. The DEA/USPS don’t block this; **Medicaid/network/licensing** do. Nail those three, and you’re good.
> 
> If you tell me your **home state** and **winter state**, I’ll sanity-check specific plan rules and name pharmacies that actually work.

> Yep—but only if you route it through the right pharmacy and plan.
> 
> # What has to be true
> - **USPS/DEA allow it.** A **DEA-registered** pharmacy can mail Schedule II meds (like Vyvanse) to you; you (or a friend) can’t legally mail it yourself. cite 
> - **Your dispensing pharmacy must be “legal” in both states.** It has to be **enrolled with Iowa Medicaid** *and* hold the right **nonresident/mail-order permit in Arizona**. Big mail-order outfits usually do. cite 
> - **Medicaid is the choke point.** Iowa Medicaid will only pay a pharmacy that’s in-network/enrolled; out-of-state is fine **if** they’re contracted properly. cite
> 
> # If you’re on one of Iowa’s MCOs (most people are)
> - **Wellpoint (ex-Amerigroup):** Uses **CarelonRx Home Delivery**; handbook literally says you can get meds **delivered to your home** (no Iowa-only limitation). Ask Member Services to confirm shipment to an Arizona address on your file. cite 
> - **Iowa Total Care:** Offers **mail-order** and runs pharmacy claims via **Express Scripts**. Have your prescriber e-send to their mail-order and ship to AZ. cite 
> - **Molina Iowa:** PBM is **CVS Caremark** (since 7/1/2023). Use Caremark mail service; confirm AZ shipping on your plan. cite
> 
> # Schedule II gotchas (Vyvanse)
> - **No refills**, but your prescriber can issue **multiple sequential e-prescriptions** totaling up to **90 days** with “do-not-fill-before” dates—handy for RV life. cite 
> - If a pharmacy can’t fill it, an **electronic** C-II script can be **transferred once** to another pharmacy (state law permitting). cite
> 
> # Quick path that actually works
> 1. **Call your MCO’s Member Services** and ask: “Which **mail-order pharmacy** on my plan can **ship to Arizona**?” (They’ll name CarelonRx, Express Scripts, or CVS Caremark depending on plan.) cite 
> 2. **Update your winter address** on file and confirm they have an **AZ nonresident permit** (they will, but ask). cite 
> 3. **Have your prescriber send EPCS** (electronic) to that mail-order. If you’ll be gone awhile, ask for **sequential 30-day scripts** up to 90 days. cite 
> 4. **Do not** DIY-mail or have someone ship it—**illegal**. Stick to the pharmacy shipment. cite
> 
> # Bottom line
> **Yes**, you can get Vyvanse mailed to your Arizona winter address—**if** you use your plan’s **in-network mail-order** that’s **Iowa-enrolled** and **Arizona-licensed**. The federal rules don’t block you; the **network/licensing** details do. Nail those and you’re fine.
> 
> If you tell me which Iowa plan you’re on (Wellpoint, Iowa Total Care, or Molina), I’ll give you the exact phone number, mail-order option, and the script wording to hand your prescriber.

> So we're gone from like november to may
<!-- UID: 8b1d8776-14b1-420a-a92f-0bdb0284c5f0 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/11/2025 at 1:04 PM
> Got it. November → May is long enough that you need a **repeatable, boring** system—not last-minute pharmacy roulette.
> 
> Here’s the straight playbook for **Iowa Medicaid → winter in Arizona** with **Vyvanse (C-II)**:
> 
> ## What the rules allow (and block)
> - **Mailing a C-II is legal** if it’s shipped **by a DEA-registered pharmacy** following CSA/USPS rules. (You or a friend mailing it = no.) USPS Pub. 52 explicitly allows mailable controlleds from pharmacies with the right packaging/labeling. cite 
> - **One prescriber can issue multiple sequential C-II e-prescriptions** totaling **up to 90 days**, each with a **“do not fill before”** date. This is how you avoid “early refill” fights while you’re gone. cite 
> - If a pharmacy runs out: an **electronic** C-II **can be transferred once** for initial fill (state law permitting). Useful if a mail-order is short and you need a local AZ fill. cite 
> - To ship into AZ, the dispensing pharmacy must hold an **Arizona nonresident pharmacy permit**. Big mail-order houses usually do; AZ publishes the requirement and a license lookup. cite 
> - **Medicaid residency:** you can remain an **Iowa** Medicaid resident while **temporarily absent** (e.g., wintering) **if you intend to return**; the feds literally say the state can’t terminate you just for a temporary absence. cite
> 
> ## Iowa Medicaid: who’s your PBM/mail-order?
> Iowa Medicaid is mostly through three MCOs. Their pharmacy backends as of 2024–2025:
> 
> - **Wellpoint (ex-Amerigroup Iowa)** → **CarelonRx** (home delivery available). cite 
> - **Iowa Total Care** → **Express Scripts** (PBM; home delivery available). cite 
> - **Molina Healthcare of Iowa** → **CVS Caremark** (PBM; mail service). cite
> 
> (Each of those mail-order pharmacies commonly ships controlled meds and may require adult signature; details vary by plan and drug.) cite
> 
> ## Do this in September/October (before you roll out)
> 1. **Call your MCO Member Services** and say: 
>  “I’ll be in **Arizona Nov–May**. Which **in-network mail-order** should I use, and can they **ship to AZ** on my plan?” 
>  - Wellpoint IA: **833-731-2140**. cite 
>  - Iowa Total Care: **833-404-1061**. cite 
>  - Molina IA: **844-236-0894**. cite 
>  Ask them to add your **winter shipping address** and confirm the pharmacy’s **AZ nonresident permit** (or give you their license number so you can check the AZ board site). cite
> 2. **Line up the prescriptions:** ask your prescriber to send **EPCS** to that mail-order for **three 30-day Vyvanse scripts** with “Do not fill before” dates (e.g., **Nov 1 / Dec 1 / Jan 1**). That’s your first **90 days** handled by the book. cite 
> 3. **Ask the pharmacy** about delivery quirks: any **adult-signature** requirement, **auto-ship** allowed for C-II (often **no**, you approve each month), and **cut-off dates** so packages don’t chase you around. cite
> 
> ## Mid-winter rinse/repeat
> - **Late January:** do a quick **follow-up** with your prescriber and have them issue the next **Nov–May block’s** three dated scripts (**Feb 1 / Mar 1 / Apr 1**; add **May 1** if you’re still down there). Still through the same mail-order. cite 
> - **If a shortage hits**: have the mail-order **transfer the e-Rx once** to an AZ retail pharmacy that has stock (CVS/Walgreens/etc.). **One transfer only** per DEA’s rule; after that, you’d need a fresh script. cite
> 
> ## Common pitfalls (and how to not step in them)
> - **DIY mailing** from Iowa or a friend: **illegal** for controlled meds. Only a **DEA-registered pharmacy** ships. cite 
> - **“90-day fill” vs “90-day total”**: DEA allows **90-day total via sequential scripts**, but your **plan may still require 30-day fills** for stimulants. Don’t fight that; just use dated monthly scripts and let the pharmacy ship each month. (Express Scripts/CVS/Carelon all support home delivery; the exact day-supply is plan-driven.) cite 
> - **Pharmacy licensure**: if someone suggests a smaller mail-order, **verify AZ nonresident permit** first (AZ enforces this). cite 
> - **Residency freak-outs**: being gone **Nov–May** doesn’t nuke your Iowa Medicaid **if you intend to return** and haven’t enrolled as an AZ resident. That’s black-letter federal Medicaid policy. cite
> 
> If you tell me **which MCO you’re on**, I’ll give you the exact **mail-order name** on your plan, the **setup steps**, and a **one-paragraph script** you can hand your prescriber.

> I think it's amerigroup? It occured to me... I don't think I have to actually do an appointment with my doctor every month in this state? In new jersey they required an appointment, my doctor had to schedule one at the end of every session. My doctor here didn't do that.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/11/2025 at 1:10 PM
> Short version: you don’t need a monthly visit by law. New Jersey likely forced it via clinic/insurer policy + NJ’s stricter 30-day C-II limits. Iowa doesn’t mandate monthly check-ins for stimulants, and the DEA’s telemedicine flex is still in effect through **Dec 31, 2025**—so your Iowa prescriber can keep you going while you winter in AZ, as long as they follow the rules. cite
> 
> # What actually matters
> - **Mailing is fine** (by the pharmacy only): USPS allows controlleds in the mail from a DEA-registered pharmacy with proper labeling/packaging. Don’t DIY-mail it. cite 
> - **No federal “monthly visit” rule for Vyvanse.** NJ *does* hard-limit C-II to **30-day supply at a time**, which tends to produce monthly touchpoints; that’s not universal. cite 
> - **Iowa specifics**: 
>  - Prescribers may issue **multiple C-II scripts totaling up to 90 days** with “do-not-fill-before” dates—perfect for RV life. cite 
>  - **E-prescribing is mandatory** in Iowa (since 2020), which plays nicely with mail-order. cite 
> - **Your plan** (Amerigroup IA ⇒ now **Wellpoint**): they route mail-order through **CarelonRx**. You can enroll and have it shipped to your AZ address. cite 
> - **Telehealth**: DEA/HHS extended the pandemic telemedicine prescribing flex through **2025**, so your Iowa doc can continue managing C-IIs by telemedicine, subject to state law + clinical judgment. cite
> 
> # Do this (once, in Sept/Oct)
> 1. **Enroll in CarelonRx home delivery** and put your **AZ winter address** on file. 
>  - Wellpoint IA pharmacy page has mail-order enrollment; CarelonRx Home Delivery member line: **833-396-0309**. cite 
> 2. **Ask your prescriber** to send **EPCS** to *CarelonRx Home Delivery* for **three 30-day lisdexamfetamine scripts** with earliest-fill dates (e.g., **Nov 1 / Dec 1 / Jan 1**). That’s your first 90 days, compliant with Iowa’s rule. cite 
> 3. **Late January**, repeat for **Feb / Mar / Apr** (and **May** if you stay). 
> 4. **Delivery details**: ask CarelonRx whether **adult signature** is required for your address; they flag some controlleds/states for signature on delivery. cite
> 
> # Why NJ felt different
> NJ’s code caps C-II fills at **30 days** and has other tight CDS rules. Many clinics/insurers there layer on monthly follow-ups or HEDIS-style check-ins. That’s policy, not federal law. Iowa doesn’t impose the same cadence. cite
> 
> # Script you can hand your prescriber
> > “Please send **EPCS** to **CarelonRx Home Delivery** for *lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) [dose]* as **three 30-day prescriptions** with ‘**Do Not Fill Before**’ dates of **[Nov 1]**, **[Dec 1]**, **[Jan 1]**. Member is on **Wellpoint Iowa (Medicaid)** and will be in **Arizona** Nov–May. CarelonRx will ship to the AZ address on file.”
> 
> If you want, tell me your exact **dose** and I’ll tailor the wording further. But big picture: you’re good to get it mailed to Arizona without monthly appointments, provided you run it through Wellpoint/CarelonRx and your prescriber uses sequential EPCS.

> Very good. Well that is a load off my shoulders. I was worried I'd have to either go with out it or switch to adderall. Which, I don't like.
<!-- UID: 47fc3a90-75b0-4cce-bcd8-88939a7b7947 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/11/2025 at 1:24 PM
> Totally fair. You don’t need to switch to Adderall or play refill roulette.
> 
> Here’s the **boring, reliable** setup for Nov→May:
> 
> - **Confirm plan**: If your card says *Amerigroup/Wellpoint Iowa*, use **CarelonRx Home Delivery**. Put your AZ winter address on file. 
> - **Get 90 days queued**: Ask your prescriber for **three 30-day EPCS** with “Do Not Fill Before” dates (Nov 1 / Dec 1 / Jan 1) to CarelonRx. 
> - **Mid-Jan repeat**: Have them send the next set (Feb 1 / Mar 1 / Apr 1 — and May 1 if needed). 
> - **Delivery realities**: Ask if **adult signature** is required; make sure the ship-to is a place you can actually sign (RV park office/UPS Store mailbox is fine). Don’t rely on forwarding. 
> - **Shortage fallback**: If CarelonRx is out, have them **transfer the e-Rx once** to a local AZ pharmacy that has stock. 
> - **Generic consistency**: If you notice differences between manufacturers, ask the pharmacy to keep the **same generic manufacturer** each month (or stick with brand if your plan covers it). 
> - **No monthly visit needed**: Keep periodic telehealth check-ins on your doc’s cadence, but there’s no federal “every month” rule forcing appointments.
> 
> If you want, I’ll:
> - draft a **one-paragraph note for your prescriber**, and 
> - a **30-second call script** for Wellpoint/CarelonRx to set up home delivery.
> 
> Want me to also set a **Jan 20** reminder to cue the second batch? (I can schedule it if you say yes.)
