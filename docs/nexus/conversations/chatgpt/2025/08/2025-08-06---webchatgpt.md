> If you're using **i3** and looking for a **better task launcher than `dmenu`**, here are some strong alternatives:
> 
> 1. **rofi** – The most popular and feature-rich replacement for `dmenu`. It supports window switching, ssh launcher, run mode, and can even act as a file browser or custom script launcher. Easily themed and extended.
> 
> 2. **wofi** – A Wayland-native alternative to `rofi`, useful if you're using a compositor like `sway`.
> 
> 3. **bemenu** – A `dmenu`-compatible menu that works on both X11 and Wayland. Lightweight and scriptable.
> 
> 4. **xmenu** – Minimal and very fast, but less interactive; works well with static menus defined via script.
> 
> 5. **j4-dmenu-desktop** – Specifically built to show `.desktop` entries; works great if you want application launching like full desktop environments.
> 
> **Best pick**: If you're on X11 and want the most capable, go with **`rofi`**. It's well-documented, fast, and extensible.
