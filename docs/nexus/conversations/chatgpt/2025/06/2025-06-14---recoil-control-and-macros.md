> Straight up seems like a lot of people in apex use macros or something to compensate for recoil. I can understand them minimizing it, but having 0 recoil at all seems insane to me. I've heard of jiggle aiming, but I've never been able to get that to work. Is it a thing?

> Yeah, it’s **definitely a thing**, and your suspicion is valid—**some people in Apex do use recoil macros**, especially on PC. Let’s break this down into the **legit techniques** versus **gray-area or outright cheating**, and then I’ll explain **jiggle aiming** in more detail:
>

> 
> ### 🧠 **1. Legitimate Recoil Control Techniques**
> These take practice, but they're all **manual and fair**:
> - **Pull patterns**: Most guns have consistent recoil patterns. Players memorize these (e.g., R-301 pulls slightly down and right) and counteract with precise mouse movement.
> - **Micro-tracking**: Instead of dragging your aim smoothly, you make tiny corrections rapidly—looks like jitter, but it’s deliberate.
> - **Jitter aiming** (aka *jiggle aiming* or *stutter strafe aiming*): Some players use very subtle side-to-side movements (ADAD spamming or strafing) to keep their recoil reset slightly or stay sticky on the hitbox.
> - **Recoil reset tap-firing**: Especially with guns like the Flatline or Hemlok, tap-firing can completely avoid recoil if timed right.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧨 **2. Recoil Macros or Cheats (Illegal)**
> These are scripts or hardware-based macros (e.g., on Logitech, Razer, or XIM devices) that:
> - Automatically pull the mouse down in sync with a weapon’s recoil pattern.
> - Result in **laser-straight beams**, even on hard-to-control guns like the R-99 or Nemesis at full spray.
> 
> Some people mask it well by combining real aim with macros, so it looks less obvious—but if it’s *perfectly stable* with no vertical/horizontal bounce at all? Probably not legit.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🎯 **3. Jiggle Aiming Explained**
> “Jiggle aiming” is more about **positioning** and **aim correction**, not recoil control. It’s often confused with:
> - **Jiggle peeking** (showing yourself briefly around corners).
> - **Strafe aiming**, where players move side to side while tracking to help maintain aim.
> 
> In Apex, **jiggle aiming helps with tracking** close-range targets—especially with SMGs. The trick is to:
> - Lightly strafe while firing (small A/D taps), not full-strafe swings.
> - Let your aim ride the edge of the strafe arc, using your body movement to do the micro-adjustments instead of only the mouse.
> - It feels weird at first, but it *is* real and used by top players (especially controller players who blend stick drift and movement).
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔧 Tips to Train Without Macros:
> - Use the **Flatline** in the firing range with 2x or 1x sights—practice pulling down and slightly left to right.
> - Try hip-fire sprays at midrange and watch your recoil *visually*—your hand should begin to *feel* the pattern.
> - Practice **bursting**, especially if tracking is hard during full auto.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🚨 TL;DR
> - Yes, some players absolutely cheat with macros.
> - But there's a **high skill ceiling** for legit recoil control.
> - **Jiggle aiming** is real, but more about *movement + micro-corrections* than pure recoil control.
> 
> You can get close to "no recoil" with enough muscle memory—but perfect beams every time? That’s suspect.
> 
> Want a drill setup to train recoil legit? I can give you a few firing range routines.
