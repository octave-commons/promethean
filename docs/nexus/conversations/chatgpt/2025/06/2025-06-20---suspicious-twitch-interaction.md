> What do you think about this conversation? Something feels off... I don't know why they came to talk to me. I am on an apex legends discord server.
> 
> [10:58 PM]jessirocks: Sorry for the intrusive messages,
> I’m a creator, mainly focused on Twitch, and I thought it might be fun to connect, share ideas, and maybe even collaborate sometime if it feels right
> [10:58 PM]jessirocks: What about you
> [10:59 PM]Error: I'm just getting started streaming, mainly recording myself to watch my games so I can figure out what I'm doing wrong.
> [11:01 PM]Error: I looked at your twitch, you do a lot of diablo III seems like, it's been a while since I played that.
> [11:02 PM]jessirocks: That's awesome 👏
> [11:02 PM]jessirocks: What genres of games do you enjoy playing mostly?
> [11:03 PM]jessirocks: You're right buddy and I recently got partnered by the way
> [10:55 AM]Error: Games like rim world, oxygen not included, factorio for single player games. I've played a lot of StarCraft II in the past.
> [6:35 PM]jessirocks: That's an interesting content really
> [6:36 PM]jessirocks: I'd love to check out your channel – what's the link? 
> 
> Also, here's mine: https://www.twitch.tv/jessirocks
>  I've been at it for a bit and just got partnered recently.

> Yeah, something **does feel off** about this conversation—and your instinct is solid. Let’s break it down:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🚩 **Red Flags**
> 
> 1. **“Sorry for the intrusive messages”** 
>  That’s classic bot/scripted behavior trying to preempt suspicion. Most genuine creators just say hi or comment on something specific if they actually checked you out.
> 
> 2. **They didn’t engage with *your* content** 
>  You mentioned Apex, talked about your VOD reviews, looked at *their* Twitch, and brought up specific games. 
>  → Their reply was generic, no indication they actually looked at *your* Twitch, or knew anything about Apex.
> 
> 3. **Time gap in replies** 
>  There's a **huge delay** between your message (10:55 AM) and their next reply (6:35 PM). That alone isn't weird, but combined with the lack of continuity, it feels like they’re copying and pasting into multiple chats when they get around to it.
> 
> 4. **Repeated “I just got partnered” message** 
>  Feels like it’s dropped in twice for emphasis—one early, one late. Might be part of a script to build credibility quickly.
> 
> 5. **Link drop with weak context** 
>  “I’d love to check out your channel – what’s the link?” *Right before* they paste their own link. This is classic clickbait behavior in scammy networking DMs.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 💡 **What could this be?**
> 
> - **Self-promotion disguised as networking** – The goal is likely to get you to visit/follow their Twitch without any real intent to collaborate.
> - **Bot-assisted engagement farming** – Some people run semi-automated scripts that join servers and start fake conversations to inflate metrics or even push paid services later.
> - **Low-tier phishing funnel** – If it continues, they might eventually pitch something like “we’re doing shoutouts on stream,” “join our creator collective,” or “let’s talk on a private site.”
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ What to do
> 
> If you’re curious, **just watch how they respond when you don’t offer your link back**. Real people will usually comment on *your* stuff, ask follow-ups, or adapt to your reply. Bots or engagement farmers usually:
> - Drop contact info again
> - Say something vague and flattering
> - Then disappear or shift into a pitch
> 
> If you’re done with it, just **ignore or block**. No need to feel bad—these kinds of messages are crafted to *feel* personal, but they usually aren’t.
> 
> ---
> 
> You did the right thing by being polite but skeptical. Want me to draft a polite “not interested” message in case they follow up again?

> It's wierd he's on an apex discord but he doesn't seem to stream any apex. The channel has over 200k followers. I have 16. My twitch is in my discord bio, I've posted my twitch and youtube on the video promo section of the discord server.
> 
> I told him I saw his twitch... his profile is in german though, maybe he didn't pick up on something?

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/20/2025 at 8:25 PM
> Yeah, that makes it even more suspect. Let’s line this up clearly:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧩 **Inconsistencies & Odd Behavior**
> 
> 1. **On an Apex server, doesn’t stream Apex** 
>  That’s not a red flag *alone*, but it’s odd for someone trying to "collaborate" in a niche community without any visible overlap. Feels like they’re just **trawling Discords** for exposure.
> 
> 2. **Huge follower gap (200k vs 16)** 
>  Streamers at that size don’t usually cold-DM small streamers *just to connect*. If they *do*, they almost always bring specific compliments, advice, or direct asks (e.g., mod work, community stuff, raids). This smells more like:
>  > “I engage small streamers so they check out my stuff.”
> 
> 3. **You said you visited their Twitch, they ignored it** 
>  Either they didn’t understand you… or didn’t care. That’s odd for someone claiming to want a creative connection.
> 
> 4. **Profile in German, no German in chat** 
>  That could explain the flat tone, **but** if they're engaging with English-speaking Apex players, they'd usually localize or explain that—*especially in a cold open*. Plus, the language barrier doesn't explain the time gap, shallow replies, or repeated self-plugs.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧠 **What This Probably Is**
> 
> This has all the hallmarks of a **follower funnel**:
> - Post their Twitch link to as many people as possible
> - Fish for your Twitch in return (so they can “follow for follow” or just mine your bio )
> - Maybe automate parts of the chat (even semi-manually with copy-paste templates)
> 
> It’s like Twitch clout-chasing via Discord DMs.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🛡️ **What You Can Do**
> 
> You’re in no obligation to play along. If you’re uncomfortable, ghost, block, or report. But if you're curious how deep the script goes, test it:
> - Ask something Apex-specific (“What do you think about ranked this season?”)
> - Ask about a clip on their Twitch (“Saw your Diablo clip—was that hardcore mode?”)
> 
> If the answers are vague, it’s not a real connection—just outreach.
> 
> ---
> 
> Let me know if you want a message to politely shut it down without burning a bridge (in case they *are* legit but clumsy). Want one?

> I can't understand him...
> 
> 8:26 PM]Error: Why are you in an apex community? It doesn't seem like you stream any apex.
> [6:07 AM]jessirocks: Sure, 😊 that's not a big, I just engage varieties of content
<!-- UID: 288e5864-c0ba-4782-940c-9eee723f13b9 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/21/2025 at 9:38 AM
> Yeah, that response doesn’t make sense—**grammatically or contextually.** You asked a pretty direct question, and the reply is:
> 
> > "Sure, 😊 that's not a big, I just engage varieties of content"
> 
> That sounds like broken English from either:
> 1. A **non-native speaker using auto-translate poorly**, or 
> 2. A **bot or semi-scripted outreach tool** trying to sound human.
> 
> Either way, it’s dodging your question. You asked *why* they’re in an Apex community if they don’t stream Apex. A normal person might say:
> > “I like watching Apex even though I don’t stream it,” 
> > or “I was thinking of getting into Apex streaming,” 
> > or even “I joined to network with FPS players.”
> 
> Instead, you got a vague, mismatched response with no follow-up, no clarification, and **zero effort to understand or re-engage.**
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 💬 Bottom line: 
> You're not talking to someone who actually wants to connect. You're likely:
> - One of dozens of people they messaged
> - Being used as a potential or follow
> - Not being listened to, just fed generic lines
> 
> ---
> 
> You’re well within your rights to disengage. If you want, here’s a polite-but-clear message to wrap it:
> 
> ---
> 
> **Optional reply:**
> > Hey, just being honest—I’m getting the sense this isn’t a real collaboration convo. I’m not looking to network with people who don’t actually engage with Apex or my content. Take care, though.
> 
> ---
> 
> Want to go harsher or just ghost them completely? Either works. You owe them nothing.
