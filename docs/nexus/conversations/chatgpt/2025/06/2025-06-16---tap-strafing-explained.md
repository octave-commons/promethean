> **Tap-strafing** is an advanced movement technique in *Apex Legends* that lets you make sharp, sudden turns in midair without losing momentum. It’s especially useful for dodging shots, staying on high ground, or pulling off unexpected jukes.
> 
> ### ⚙️ How It Works (Mechanically)
> Tap-strafing exploits the way Apex handles directional input on mouse and keyboard. The core idea is:
> - When you’re in the air and **hold forward (W)**, your momentum continues in that direction.
> - But if you **flick your movement keys (A/D)** and rapidly change your movement vector using **scroll wheel bound to forward (W)**, you can sharply curve your momentum midair.
> 
> This works because:
> - Apex allows near-instant input changes from movement keys.
> - Mouse & keyboard players can bind **"Move Forward" to their scroll wheel**, letting them "tap" directional changes repeatedly and rapidly.
> 
> ### 🎮 Input Setup (PC only)
> To tap-strafe:
> 1. Go to your keybinds.
> 2. Bind **“Move Forward”** to **scroll wheel up or down** (keep W too).
> 3. While running and jumping (preferably out of a slide), **move your mouse in the direction you want to turn**, then **scroll wheel + strafe key** (A or D depending on your turn direction).
> 
> ### 🌀 How To Do It
> 1. Start a **sprint-slide-jump**.
> 2. As you're airborne, **flick your mouse in the turn direction** (say, right).
> 3. While in air:
>  - Hold **D** (right strafe).
>  - Scroll wheel (tap-strafe).
> 4. Your legend will hook sharply in midair to the right.
> 
> You can chain this to move like you're wall-running or double-backing around corners.
>

> 
> ### 🧠 Why Use It?
> 
> | Use Case | Advantage |
> |----------|-----------|
> | **Breaking aim assist** | Makes controller players whiff their shots. |
> | **Dodging in 1v1s** | Makes you harder to hit during mid-air fights. |
> | **Wall-bounce escapes** | Let’s you sharply turn off walls. |
> | **Staying on ledges or ziplines** | You can hook midair to land where most players would overshoot. |
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🛑 Limitations
> 
> - **Controller players can't tap-strafe**, even on PC.
> - **It’s been nerfed for movement inputs on controllers** due to fairness.
> - Can be tricky to master and inconsistent without clean execution.
> - May get patched or further limited in future updates.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧪 Training Drill
> Try this in the Firing Range:
> 1. Slide jump off a ramp.
> 2. Turn your mouse hard left or right.
> 3. Tap-strafe (scroll wheel + hold A or D).
> 4. Land back on the ramp or hook onto the ledge.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/16/2025 at 4:20 PM
> Absolutely. Here's a categorized list of movement techniques in *Apex Legends*, from basic to advanced, including keyboard/mouse and some controller-specific ones where relevant.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧱 **Core Movement Techniques**
> These are foundational and required for mastering more advanced movement.
> 
> | Technique | Description |
> |----------|-------------|
> | **Slide Jump** | Crouch while sprinting to slide, then jump to carry momentum forward. |
> | **Bunny Hopping (B-Hop)** | Repeated jumping while healing or strafing to maintain speed. Requires good timing and strafing in air. |
> | **Crouch Spam** | Rapid crouching during gunfights to throw off enemy aim. |
> | **Wall Climb / Super Climb** | Hold jump at a wall to climb up. Some ledges allow *super climbs* (climbing higher than seems possible with momentum and timing). |
> | **Crouch Slide Peek** | Slide into cover and briefly expose yourself for a quick peek. |
> 
> ---
> 
> ## ⚙️ **Momentum-Based Techniques**
> These preserve or redirect movement speed for aggressive or evasive plays.
> 
> | Technique | Description |
> |----------|-------------|
> | **Tap Strafing** | Midair redirection using scroll-wheel bound to "move forward." Allows sharp turns or staying on ledges. |
> | **Wall Bounce** | Jump toward a wall, hit it at an angle, and bounce off by jumping just before impact (no mantle). Useful for dodging or re-engaging. |
> | **Super Glide** | Climb up a ledge, then perfectly time a jump + slide to launch forward faster than normal. Hard to master. |
> | **Edge Boosting** | Slide over a sloped surface (like a hill edge) and jump at the end to gain extra speed. |
> | **Slope Jumping** | Jump at the end of a slope (like a ramp or staircase) to preserve or boost momentum. |
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🎯 **Combat Movement Techniques**
> Useful specifically during duels or close-range fights.
> 
> | Technique | Description |
> |----------|-------------|
> | **Strafe Jiggle / A-D Spamming** | Rapid left/right movement during fights to dodge shots. Timing must be unpredictable. |
> | **Jiggle Peeking** | Expose only part of your hitbox to bait shots and return fire. Works well with head glitches. |
> | **Air Strafing** | Steering your character mid-air using movement keys. More effective on mouse + keyboard. |
> | **Drop Strafing** | Combine fall momentum (like dropping from a ledge) with strafing mid-air to break line of sight. |
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🛠️ **Tech + Utility Interactions**
> These use environmental elements, abilities, or equipment for movement.
> 
> | Technique | Description |
> |----------|-------------|
> | **Zipline Super Jump** | Jump onto a zipline and immediately jump again to gain extra height. (Timing: interact → jump instantly.) |
> | **Zipline Bounce** | Spam interact/jump on vertical ziplines to "bounce" up and down unpredictably. |
> | **Gravity Cannon Cloak (Crypto)** | Enter drone mid-flight after using a gravity cannon to mask direction and delay ring pings. |
> | **Octane Jump Pad Redirect** | Hit the pad at an angle, crouch jump, and air strafe to sharply change direction. |
> | **Valk Jet Strafing** | Short, controlled bursts of Valkyrie’s jetpack allow for unpredictable vertical fights. |
> | **Wraith Portal Slingshot** | Combine portal exit momentum with jumping to launch farther. |
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🎮 **Controller-Specific**
> Controller players have different movement limits and strengths.
> 
> | Technique | Description |
> |----------|-------------|
> | **Forward-Strafe Spam** | Use analog precision to rapidly strafe while maintaining forward pressure. |
> | **Button Jumping** | Remap jump to a bumper for better movement while aiming. |
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧠 Bonus Category: **Mindgame Movement**
> These are less mechanical, more tactical.
> 
> | Technique | Description |
> |----------|-------------|
> | **Sound Baiting** | Make loud noises (footsteps, zips, doors) intentionally to mislead. |
> | **Decoy Movement (Mirage)** | Sync your movement with decoys for confusion. |
> | **Stealth Sliding** | Crouch-slide slowly off ledges to make no sound. |
>
