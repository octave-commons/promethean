> A recruiter approached me recently, I had a call with them. Afterwards I recieved the following email:
> ```
> Hi Aaron, 
>  
> Dropping you a quick note because Michael referred you to the Founding Full Stack Engineer (Healthcare & AI/Data Focus) role at Legacy. 
>  
> While it's not a fit for this particular role, we genuinely think you're fantastic (and don't say this to everybody). 
>  
> Reasons provided: Legacy is looking for more healthcare experience and experience leading a team directly. 
>  
> So: 
> a) we're keeping you on the shortlist for future roles 
> b) if you'd like to apply to be a Twill member, we'd love to have you — link here: [https://app.withtwill.com/apply?source=preapproved](https://app.withtwill.com/apply?source=preapproved) 
> c) feel free to reply back to let us know more about what you're looking for 
>  
> Talk soon, 
> The Twill Team
> ```
> 
> How should I reply to this? How do I articulate the kind of job I'm looking for?

> 
> ---
> 
> **Subject:** Re: Legacy Role & Next Steps 
> 
> Hi [Twill Team / Recruiter's Name], 
> 
> Thank you for the thoughtful follow-up — and I appreciate you passing along the feedback. Totally understand Legacy’s requirements and I’m glad to hear I’m still on the radar for future opportunities. 
> 
> As for what I’m looking for: 
> I'm focused on impactful early-stage roles where I can contribute both as an engineer and as a strategic thinker. Ideally something in the **AI, infrastructure, or developer tools space**, though I’m open to other domains if the mission is compelling. I’m especially ex about teams working at the intersection of **data, autonomy, and human-centric design**. 
> 
> I’ve led high-performing teams in the past (though not always with the “manager” title), and I’m often the person who builds v0, unblocks others, and lays the groundwork for scale — whether that’s code, architecture, or process. I thrive in ambiguity, and I’m usually brought in when things are complex, messy, or need a creative path forward. 
> 
> If that resonates with any upcoming roles, I’d love to hear more. In the meantime, I’ll definitely check out the Twill application. 
> 
> Warm regards,

> Let me know if you want to customize this further — for example, to emphasize remote work, a specific tech stack, or your startup background.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/14/2025 at 12:20 PM
> Absolutely — let’s dig in and sharpen the language around your ideal role. Here are a few guiding questions first, so I can help tailor this precisely:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 1. **Stage & Impact**
> - Do you prefer early-stage startups (0–10 people)? Growth-stage? Established companies?
> - Do you want to be building the v1 product or scaling something that already has traction?
> 
> ### 2. **Scope of Work**
> - Are you looking to code full-time, lead a team, or split time between technical and strategic leadership?
> - Do you want to own architecture and systems, product direction, internal tooling, etc.?
> 
> ### 3. **Domains**
> - You mentioned interest in AI, data, and developer tools. Would you also consider healthcare, fintech, social good, etc.?
> - Are you looking for a “mission-driven” company, or just strong technical challenges?
> 
> ### 4. **Team Culture**
> - Do you want to be surrounded by senior peers? Or help mentor more junior devs?
> - Do you want async, deep work culture? Or more collaborative, real-time interaction?
> 
> ### 5. **Work Environment**
> - Remote-only? Hybrid OK? Any timezone preferences?
> - Do you want a small team with lots of hats, or a larger org with clearer roles?
> 
> ---
> 
> If you answer some of those, I can help craft a tight, 2–3 paragraph description of your ideal role.
> 
> But even without that, here’s a **general version** that already leans into your background and interests:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧠 Draft: "What I'm Looking For"
> 
> I’m looking for a role where I can build and iterate quickly, ideally as part of a small, high-trust team. My sweet spot is early-stage product development — taking messy problems and shaping them into working systems, whether that’s architecting backend infrastructure, shipping thoughtful user experiences, or designing internal workflows. 
> 
> I’m especially drawn to work at the intersection of **AI, developer tools, data infrastructure**, and **systems that enhance human decision-making**. I bring a strong bias for clarity, autonomy, and shipping value fast — and I’m often the one laying down early foundations (technical and organizational) in complex, high-ambiguity environments. 
> 
> Remote-first is ideal, and I tend to thrive with asynchronous teams that value deep thinking, honest feedback, and long-term impact over short-term busyness.
> 
> ---
> 
> Would you like a more concise or more detailed version of that? Or we can tailor it to a specific audience like VCs, recruiters, or hiring managers.

> Here’s a concise, authentic version you can send in a reply, or reuse in conversations with recruiters and hiring managers:
> 
> ---
> 
> **What I’m Looking For**
> 
> I’m looking for a **remote-first role at an early-stage startup** where I can help build the v1 product — ideally as part of a small, highly capable team. I want to spend most of my time coding, and I gravitate toward work where I can take ownership of the **architecture, internal tooling, and system design**. I’m less interested in product direction unless something conflicts with my values — I prefer to focus on building things that work well and scale intelligently.
> 
> My ideal environment is **fast-moving but thoughtful** — where there’s trust, technical depth, and a clear need to solve hard problems. I’ve worked in govtech before, and I’d prefer not to go back; I’d rather work on something challenging that’s **not entangled in bureaucracy**. I’m open to domains like healthcare (even if I don’t have direct experience there), but I’m skeptical of companies that overemphasize being “mission-driven” — I care more about whether a team is honest, competent, and doing meaningful work without the branding.
> 
> In parallel, I’m building a game engine and an indie title on my own time — so I know how to ship, how to lead myself, and how to keep momentum without needing management overhead.
> 
> ---
> 
> Let me know if you want a sharper or more casual version. Or if you want to add a paragraph about specific tech you like working with (e.g. Python, Docker, Rust, etc).

> I like early stage startups. I would like to build the v1 product. I'd prefer to code full time. I like to take ownership of the architecture and systems, internal tooling. Product direction is less important to me unless it conflicts with my values. Healthcare wouldn't be a bad place to work, though I have no experience working there. That was the reason I was not a good fit for this last job. I've done work in govtech before, but I don't want to go back to that. A "mission driven" company to me smells of anti culture. The more a company claims to be one thing, the more I doubt it. I see it all the time, someone I knew from a job on posting about X only to be doing the opposite. I just want to be challenged on something that isn't for the government. I'd really like to get into game development, but I think that is something I will do on my own. Publish an indie game with my own game engine.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/14/2025 at 12:30 PM
> Perfect — that nuance really matters, and you’ve framed it thoughtfully. Here’s a revised version that integrates your views on values without sounding preachy or self-righteous:
> 
> ---
> 
> **What I’m Looking For**
> 
> I’m looking for a **remote-first role at an early-stage startup**, ideally U.S.-based, where I can help build the **v1 product** as part of a small, capable team. I want to spend most of my time writing code, owning **architecture, systems, and internal tooling**. I thrive in environments with technical depth, minimal red tape, and a bias toward action.
> 
> I’m open on industry — I don’t need a “mission-driven” company, just one that’s **aligned with my values**. For me, that means I’m not interested in building tools for **casinos, the military, or extractive finance**. I’d feel much better working on something like **healthcare, creative tools, developer infrastructure, or even games or productivity software** — areas where the work either directly helps people or at least doesn’t work against them.
> 
> I’m not looking to manage people right now. I’d rather contribute deeply as an engineer, especially in places where early technical decisions still matter. On the side, I’m building my own game engine and indie title — so I know how to lead myself and keep momentum, even in ambiguous environments.
> 
> ---
> 
> Would you like to tweak this further for tone — more casual, more assertive, more “startup bro,” more academic, etc.?

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 06/14/2025 at 12:30 PM
> I'd like to be a bit more clear about what I mean when I say values. I don't want to work for say a casino, the millitary. A bank is in a gray area for me, so are companies like Meta, Alphabet and its subsidiaries, etc. A hospital, a game studio, a productivity company would all align pretty well.
