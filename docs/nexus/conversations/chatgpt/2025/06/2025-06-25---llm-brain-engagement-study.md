> That study—based at MIT and detailed on brainonllm.com—is a **preprint**, not yet peer-reviewed, so treat its conclusions with serious caution cite.
> 
> ### 🧠 Study at a glance
> - **Design**: 54 participants over three essay-writing sessions. Groups: LLM-only (using ChatGPT), web-search, and “brain only.” Session 4 shuffled some participants cite.
> - **Measurements**: EEG scans tracked neural connectivity/cognitive engagement, essay content analyzed via NLP, plus interviews and scoring by humans and an “AI judge” cite.
> - **Findings**:
>  - LLM users showed weaker overall brain connectivity than searchers or unaided writers.
>  - In Session 4, those transitioning from LLM to brain-only remained under‑engaged; those going from brain to LLM had a boost similar to searchers cite.
>  - LLM group had less essay “ownership,” struggled to recall or quote their own writing cite.
> 
> ### Limitations & caveats
> - **Small, homogenous sample**: Only 54 participants, mostly from nearby academic institutions; just 18 in the key subgroups cite.
> - **Short timeframe**: Conducted over ~4 months without tracking long-term retention or learning cite.
> - **Narrow scope**: Limited to SAT‑style essay writing. Does this generalize to other tasks? The authors advise against sweeping conclusions cite.
> - **EEG constraints**: Measures connectivity, not cognitive processing depth. Spatial resolution issues, no fMRI follow-up cite.
> - **Model specificity**: Used ChatGPT (GPT‑4o). Results may differ with different LLMs cite.
> 
> ### Community reaction
> Experts like Tina Austin push back, noting sensationalist headlines like “ChatGPT kills neurons” are misleading. The study involved just ~18 people doing a specific task—steering far from claims of long-term harm cite. On Reddit, the post sparked discussion but little consensus cite.
> 
> ### My take
> The study offers interesting early data suggesting **reduced engagement when off‑loading thinking to an LLM**, but that's **entirely predictable**. The bigger question isn't “Can LLMs make us dumber?”—that's clickbait—but **how** we use them. Passive reliance likely dulls engagement; active, reflective use paired with oversight could still foster deep learning.
> 
> Remember: this is **preliminary**. It’s a starting point, not a verdict. A broader evidence base is necessary to draw practical conclusions for education or cognitive health.
> 
> ### Practical advice
> - Use LLMs as **thinking partners**, not brain replacements: e.g., brainstorm with AI, then write manually.
> - Structure tasks to **encourage productive struggle**—your brain needs friction to build neural connections.
> - If you're seeing dulling effects—difficulty recalling or explaining your own writing—take a step back from AI and **re-train active engagement**.
> 
> In short: this study raises **flags of concern**, not definitive proof. The real imperative is designing workflows and educational systems that **amplify thinking**, not diminish it.

> Yes — while this MIT “Your Brain on ChatGPT” study is one of the first *experimental EEG investigations* into LLM use and writing, it isn’t alone in exploring the intersection of AI use and brain engagement. A growing body of research is emerging, including:

> 
> ### **NeuroChat: EEG‑guided AI tutoring**
> - A **pilot study** introduced “NeuroChat,” a prototype system that monitored learner’s EEG signals in real-time and adjusted AI-generated instruction dynamically. 
> - Compared to a standard LLM chatbot, NeuroChat enhanced **cognitive and subjective engagement**, although it didn’t yet improve immediate learning outcomes citeturn0academia28. 
> - This research leans toward creating *adaptive AI systems* that scaffold rather than replace learner effort.
> 
> ### **EEG + LLM for semantic comprehension**
> - A recent study combined EEG and eye-tracking to analyze real-time brain responses during reading. It then used embeddings from LLMs (like BERT) for semantic decoding, achieving **~60% accuracy** in predicting whether a word is semantically relevant cite. 
> - Though not directly about task engagement, it shows how **neural signals and LLM output interplay**, setting a foundation for future cognitive-AI studies.

> ## 📚 Broader Context in “Brain + Tech” Research
> 
> - The emerging field of **neuroergonomics** applies EEG and other brain-imaging tools to study technology's impact on human performance and mental workload cite. 
> - These methods have previously explored brain activity during multitasking, driving, etc., but are now increasingly used to evaluate **LLM usage and AI-assisted cognitive tasks**.

> 
> | Study / Field | Focus Area | Method | Key Finding |
> |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
> | *Your Brain on ChatGPT* | Essay writing with/without LLM | EEG, NLP, interview | LLM use → reduced neural connectivity, lower engagement |
> | **NeuroChat** | Adaptive tutoring via EEG feedback | EEG + real-time LLM control | Boosted engagement but no learning gains yet |
> | **EEG + LLM comprehension** | Reading and inferencing tasks with semantic decoding | EEG + eye-tracking + LLM | Feasible to predict word relevance from brain signals |
> | Neuroergonomics | General brain-tech interaction | EEG, fNIRS, etc. | Tech affects cognitive load—framework for AI studies |

> ## 🧭 Implications & What’s Next
> 
> 1. **Proof of concept**: Beyond essays, EEG‑guided AI tutoring (NeuroChat) shows promise in *adaptive engagement*, though outcomes aren’t straightforward.
> 2. **Nascent stage**: Most studies are small-scale pilot/preprint works—early stages rather than conclusive evidence.
> 3. **Theoretical expansion**: EEG+LLM for reading comprehension hints at a future where brain-based feedback could dynamically shape AI assistance.
> 4. **Classical grounding**: Neuroergonomics reinforces that understanding cognitive demand remains key to responsibly integrating AI tools.

> ### 🗣️ My Take
> 
> - Researchers are already *experimentalizing what ‘thinking with AI’ looks like* using neural data—not just behavior or test scores.
> - The trend is towards systems that *sense under-engagement and adjust*, rather than merely providing predictive output.
> - But: **sample sizes are small**, contexts narrow, and adaptive systems like NeuroChat haven’t yet backed improvements in learning outcomes.
> - These early signals are promising, yet we’re far from generalizing about “LLMs rewiring brains” in daily life.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ Bottom Line
> 
> Yes — this MIT study is part of a budding scientific conversation exploring how AI affects real-time brain engagement. Follow-up work is venturing into **adaptive, EEG-responsive AI**, and **neural-semantic studies**. But all are early-stage and limited in scale. The core challenge remains: translating neural insights into **practical, scalable AI workflows that enhance learning** instead of dulling it.
