> I got this email, and it seems a bit suspicious. I don't recall the last time I put haskell on my resume, it's a language I have studied, but having grown as a professional I realized it was not something I should put on a resume.

> I am reaching out in regards to a new engineering role using haskell. I saw haskell on your resume and thought you might be a fit. The role is fully remote flexible and is at a financial firm. Let me know if you would be intersted in speaking about the role. If I have mistaken your background but you ae looking for different types of roles I am sure I can help you out with those as well. We have many different roles across multiple tech stacks. Let me know!!

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/16/2025 at 9:57 AM
> This email **raises several red flags** that suggest it may not be entirely legitimate—or at least not trustworthy in intent. Let's break it down:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔍 **Red Flags**
> 1. **Incorrect Resume Label**:
>  - "Hi abeavers_resume," is clearly a placeholder or filename, not a person's name. This indicates a low-effort or automated message, likely sent to scraped resumes.
> 
> 2. **Haskell Mention**:
>  - You said you don’t recall listing Haskell recently, which suggests they pulled from an outdated or scraped version. This can happen if your resume was uploaded to a job board or public site years ago.
> 
> 3. **Grammar and Typos**:
>  - Multiple typos and poor grammar:
>  - *"intersted"*, *"ae"*, etc.
>  - Professional recruiters usually take care to proofread—sloppy language suggests either spam or a low-effort mass mailing.
> 
> 4. **Financial Firm with Haskell**:
>  - While Haskell **is** used at a few notable financial firms (like Jane Street or Standard Chartered), serious firms usually don’t source talent via generic email blasts.
> 
> 5. **Scam Detector Score: 15.3**:
>  - Scam-detector.com ranks sites on a scale of 0–100. A score that low indicates a **very high risk**, particularly for:
>  - Spam
>  - Phishing
>  - Resume harvesting
> 
> 6. **Generic Recruiter Pitch**:
>  - The fallback "we have many different roles across multiple tech stacks" is a telltale sign of spam campaigns looking to harvest more personal data or resumes.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔐 **What Might Be Going On**
> - **Resume Harvesting**: They want you to respond with an updated resume (potentially with phone/address info).
> - **Recruiter Spam**: It's a generic recruiting firm email blast that’s *technically real* but low-quality and scattershot.
> - **Phishing Setup**: Less likely, but if you were to respond, they could follow up with malicious or fake interview requests.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ **What You Should Do**
> - **Do Not Respond** unless you're confident in the firm and person.
> - **Google the Recruiter** ("Dyllan Greene Cypress Group") — see if they have a LinkedIn profile or legitimate track record.
> - **Use [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io)** or similar to validate the email domain and verify if it's a known recruiter domain.
> - **Mark as Spam** if you don’t want further contact.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 📌 Verdict
> This smells like **a low-quality recruiter blast at best, and a possible scam at worst**. Proceed with caution, and do not send any updated resume or personal details unless you can independently verify the recruiter's identity and legitimacy.
> 
> Would you like me to help you look into Dyllan Greene further?

> Alright, how about this one? I thought it seemed more legit at first but they haven't called me yet after I set up an appointment, and scam detector gives their website a score of 13:

> This second email **does look more polished on the surface**, but **still has significant warning signs**—especially when paired with:
> 
> - A **Scam Detector score of 13** (very poor).
> - The fact that they **missed your scheduled call**, which is both unprofessional and suspicious.
> 
> Let’s evaluate this one critically:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧠 **What Looks Legit**
> - **More relevant skills listed**: RAG, LLMs, React, Python — matches your background better than the Haskell one.
> - **Use of Calendly**: Professional recruiters *do* use Calendly. This is a mild green flag.
> - **No grammar issues or typos**: That’s better than the first email.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧨 **Red Flags**
> 1. **Low Scam Detector Score (13)**:
>  - Indicates **very high risk**.
>  - May suggest fake listings, data harvesting, or a front for phishing.
> 
> 2. **No Job Description**:
>  - They’re "working on getting one"? A *real* recruiter has at least a **basic summary** or internal posting.
>  - This often signals fake job baiting: they’re trying to hook you before they even know what the job is.
> 
> 3. **No Company Domain Email**:
>  - The recruiter doesn't seem to be emailing from a verified Venturi domain. Can you confirm the sender's email address? If it's something like `@gmail.com` or unrelated to `venturi-group.com`, that's a red flag.
> 
> 4. **Ghosted After Scheduling**:
>  - Failing to show up to a scheduled call is **inexcusable** in professional recruiting, especially for contract-to-hire AI/ML roles.
>  - If they ghost early, they’ll likely ghost later—or worse, it was a resume phishing play all along.
> 
> 5. **Venturi Group Reputation**:
>  - They are a **real recruiting firm**, but not all recruiters working under a name do so with integrity.
>  - Recruiters sometimes misuse real company names to appear legitimate, especially if you're not talking to them through a verified corporate channel.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔐 **What Might Be Going On**
> - **Resume Harvesting**: A recruiter collects your data to pad their candidate list or bait future clients.
> - **Low-quality recruiting**: Could be real but disorganized or predatory in tactics.
> - **Fake job phishing**: If the domain and identity can’t be verified, it could be someone impersonating Venturi Group.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ **What You Should Do**
> 1. **Verify the Recruiter**:
>  - Look up *Thomas Cremmins Venturi Group* on LinkedIn. Does he exist? Does his title match?
>  - Check if his Calendly link matches his known email or domain.
> 
> 2. **Check the Email Domain**:
>  - If he emailed from anything *other than* `@venturi-group.com` or `@venturi-group.co.uk`, that’s a strong red flag.
> 
> 3. **Don’t Resend Any Info**:
>  - Until they confirm their legitimacy, don’t resend your resume, ID, address, etc.
> 
> 4. **You Can Reply, Cautiously**:
>  - If you’re still unsure, you could send a short message like:
>  > "Hi Thomas, just following up — we had a call scheduled but I didn’t hear from you. Could you please confirm your current affiliation with Venturi Group and send over the job description when available?"
> 
>  - If they don’t respond, or send vague answers, that’s your cue to cut contact.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧭 Final Verdict
> > **Probably a resume-harvesting or low-integrity recruiter, possibly impersonating a real firm.** Real roles with this skill set and remote flexibility are *highly competitive*—they don’t get pitched with this level of vagueness.
> 
> Want me to look up Thomas Cremmins for you and cross-check his LinkedIn, Calendly, and the Venturi site?

> I was contacted by him on , that was the message I got from him.
<!-- UID: 695c862a-79ef-477b-b679-6473bbcb53ac -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/16/2025 at 3:08 PM
> Thanks, that context changes things significantly.
> 
> If the message came **via LinkedIn**, from someone **whose profile appears real**, then this is far more likely to be **a legitimate but sloppy recruiter**, not a scammer. Let’s reassess with that in mind:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ **What This Likely Is Now**
> - **Legit recruiter outreach** from a real person using a real profile at Venturi Group.
> - Still potentially **low-quality** or **overloaded**, which explains:
>  - No job description.
>  - Missed meeting.
>  - Vague language.
>  - Site scoring poorly on scam-detector.com (which can be unreliable for real but low-profile recruiter firms).
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧠 **Key Possibilities**
> 1. **Overbooked / Disorganized**:
>  - He’s juggling multiple candidates and forgot or missed the meeting.
>  - Still rude, but not malicious.
> 
> 2. **Speculative Recruiting**:
>  - Common in contract/agency recruiting.
>  - He may not have a firm client role lined up and is trying to **build a candidate pool** *before* pitching to clients.
> 
> 3. **Resume Farming** (mild form):
>  - He wants you in the CRM/database so he can start showing your profile to clients even if no role exists yet.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ What You Can Safely Do Now
> If you’re still interested *at all*:
> 
> - **Follow up once**, briefly and firmly:
>  > "Hi Thomas, just checking in — we had a call scheduled, but I didn’t hear from you. Still open to a chat if you’d like to follow up with a job description or more details. Otherwise, best of luck with your search."
> 
> - **Don’t share sensitive info** (SSNs, IDs, etc.) unless it’s after multiple stages, with a contract and NDAs in place.
> 
> - If no reply after this, **let it go**. Don’t chase it.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔍 Want Me to Check His LinkedIn Profile?
> If you give me the public URL of his LinkedIn profile, I can cross-reference:
> - His job history
> - Whether other people engage with his posts
> - Whether he's connected to real Venturi Group staff
> - Whether the Calendly domain matches
> 
> Let me know if you want that check.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 06/16/2025 at 3:10 PM
> The LinkedIn URL matches a **real, active recruiter named Thomas Cremmins** at Venturi Group:
> 
> - His profile appears legitimate and lists him as a **Senior Recruitment Consultant** based in New York cite. 
> - The Venturi Group “About” page does indeed list a **Thomas Cremmins** as part of their U.S. team cite. 
> - A Venturi staffer publicly welcomed him to their New York office (around 7 months ago) cite.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ What This Confirms
> 
> 1. **Real Person, Real Firm** 
>  You were indeed contacted by a genuine recruiter from the legitimate Venturi Group.
> 
> 2. **Likely Genuine Role** 
>  It's quite possible he's working on a real AI/ML contract role, but hasn’t yet finalized the job description—which explains the lack of detail.
> 
> 3. **Unprofessional Follow-Through** 
>  Despite being legit, missing a scheduled call without follow-up reflects poorly on his professionalism.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ Next Steps Recommended
> 
> 1. **Send a Polite Follow-Up** 
>  *"Hi Thomas, I noticed we missed our call. I’m still open to learning more—could you share the job description when it’s available and reschedule our chat?"*
> 
> 2. **Request Verification 
>  - Ask for the **official Venturi email domain** and a basic JD or client project info. 
>  - This is standard and reasonable.
> 
> 3. **Hold Off on Sharing Sensitive Info** 
>  Only provide personal or detailed resume information once the job scope and recruiter alignment are clear.
> 
> 4. **Assess Responsiveness** 
>  If he re-engages professionally, it's more credible. But if he ghosts again or stays vague, treat it as low-quality outreach and step away.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🧭 Final Take
> 
> You’ve got a legitimate recruiter from a real firm—but his **follow-through so far is weak**. It’s worth giving him one more chance with a straightforward follow-up. If things improve, proceed; if not, you’ve done well by being cautious.
> 
> Shall I help draft that follow-up message—or would you like me to verify his email domain next?
