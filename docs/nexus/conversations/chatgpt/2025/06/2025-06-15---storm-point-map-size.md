> Storm Point is currently the **largest map** in *Apex Legends*, measuring approximately **1.55 square kilometers** of playable area.
> 
> Here’s how it compares to other maps:
> 
> | Map | Approx. Size (km²) |
> |----------------|---------------------|
> | **Storm Point** | **1.55** |
> | World’s Edge | ~1.44 |
> | Kings Canyon | ~1.18 |
> | Olympus | ~1.20 |
> | Broken Moon | ~1.50 |
> 
> ### What this means for gameplay:
> - **Longer rotations**: Storm Point favors legends with **mobility, recon, or verticality** (like Valkyrie, Horizon, Crypto).
> - **Wider spread of squads**: Lower encounter rates early-game; it’s harder to third-party unless you’re tracking teams via recon tools or fighting near high-traffic POIs.
> - **Zone reads matter more**: Because of the size, being on the wrong side of a zone pull can be game-losing without good planning or movement tech (e.g., gravity cannons, tridents, redeploys).
> 
> Would you like a visual reference of Storm Point’s layout or a breakdown of midgame zones and how to rotate through them?
