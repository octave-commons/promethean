> Yeah, that’s **almost certainly a bot or scammer**. Let’s break it down:
> 
> ### 🚩 Red Flags:
> 1. **Generic praise**: “great entertainment👌” – Zero mention of anything specific you did.
> 2. **Implies benefit to *you***: “would love to support you” – classic manipulation tactic to lower your guard.
> 3. **Off-platform move**: “let’s connect on Discord 👉 yungtroy23” – big red flag. Real viewers don’t *lead* with Discord invites unless you’ve already talked.
> 4. **Username format**: “yungtroy23” is the kind of username that shows up in bot farms or low-effort spam scripts.
> 5. **Emoji bait**: The 👌 and 👉 emojis are often used in bot comments to make it seem “friendly” or human.
> 
> ### What They Might Be After:
> - **Phishing**: Once you're on Discord, they may link to fake sponsor deals, malware, or crypto scams.
> - **Social engineering**: Try to trick you into downloading something or giving out info.
> - **Boost farming**: Some of these bots want you to join a server to farm engagement or Nitro boosts.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔒 What to Do:
> - **Don’t respond or add them**.
> - **Ban or report the user** on Twitch/YouTube/wherever you stream.
> - If you’re running chat overlays, consider adding a filter for messages with Discord invites or “let’s connect”.
> 
> If this becomes frequent, I can help you write a simple auto-mod rule or bot script to catch and delete them in real-time.
>
