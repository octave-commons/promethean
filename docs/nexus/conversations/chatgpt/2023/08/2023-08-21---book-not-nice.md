> No, I haven't read the book "Not Nice," as I'm a text-based AI and don't have the ability to read books in the traditional sense. If you need information about the book or have specific questions related to it, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you! If it's related to software development or artificial intelligence, I'll make sure to tailor the response to your field.

> I apologize, but as of my knowledge cut-off date in September 2021, I don't have specific information about a book titled "Not Nice." It's possible that the book was published after that date or that it's not widely recognized in the sources I have access to. If you could provide more context or details about the book, I might be able to assist you further. If it's a bad idea to pursue this line of inquiry, please let me know, and we can move on to something else.
