>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/21/2023 at 3:24 PM
> I hear you, and it's completely understandable that you're tired of dating apps. Meeting people in person can be more genuine and fulfilling. Since you're looking for a more direct approach, here's what you can do:
> 
> 1. **Attend Social Events and Gatherings:** Look for local meetups, hobby clubs, or social events that align with your interests. Since you're into software development and AI, tech conferences or meetups can be a great place to connect with like-minded individuals.
> 
> 2. **Volunteer:** Volunteering for causes you care about can put you in touch with people who share your values.
> 
> 3. **Take a Class or Workshop:** Whether it's a coding workshop or a cooking class, learning something new can be a fun way to meet people.
> 
> 4. **Be Open and Approachable:** Sometimes, meeting new people is as simple as starting a conversation with a stranger at a coffee shop or a bookstore. Being open to new connections can lead to unexpected friendships and relationships.
> 
> 5. **Ask Friends for Introductions:** If you have friends who know you well, they might know someone who would be a good match for you. Don't be shy about asking for introductions.
> 
> Remember, it's normal to feel nervous or unsure when trying to meet people in person, especially if you've been relying on apps for a while. Take it slow, be yourself, and don't be too hard on yourself if things don't click right away. Building connections takes time and effort, but it can be incredibly rewarding.
> 
> And since I'm here to be brutally honest, I'll add that there's no magic formula for finding a date. It might take some trial and error, and you might face rejection. That's a normal part of the process, and it doesn't reflect negatively on you. Keep putting yourself out there, and don't be afraid to take chances.

> I have been getting better about handling rejection, Not Nice has really helped me understand where those fears are coming from.
<!-- UID: aaa2914c-6522-4cf3-abac-1656272feb44 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/21/2023 at 3:25 PM
> That's great to hear! Overcoming the fear of rejection is a significant step in personal growth, and it's commendable that you're actively working on it. Utilizing resources like "Not Nice" by Dr. Aziz Gazipura can indeed provide valuable insights into understanding and managing those fears.
> 
> Since you're making progress in this area, it should empower you to approach social situations with more confidence and resilience. Remember, rejection isn't a failure; it's just a sign that something wasn't the right fit. It doesn't diminish your value or worth.
> 
> Keep embracing the lessons you've learned, and continue to put yourself out there. Your newfound understanding of rejection and your willingness to face it head-on will likely lead to more meaningful connections and opportunities in the future.
> 
> If you have any specific questions or need further advice on this topic, feel free to ask!

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/21/2023 at 3:26 PM
> I am having difficulty understanding what I want. It seems quite arbitrary, yet clearly there are things I like and do not like. I spent a long time molding myself to others expectations, and I lived in isolation surrounded by people I know for a fact I didn't like. What I do not like is much more clear to me than what I do.
<!-- UID: aaa21140-95a5-449b-a933-1b263cf13d36 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/21/2023 at 3:27 PM
> Your feelings of uncertainty about what you want, especially after a period of conforming to others' expectations, are not uncommon. It's a complex issue, and I'll do my best to provide some guidance.
> 
> 1. **Identify Your Values:** Understanding what you stand for can help clarify what you want in life. Your values are the core principles that guide your decisions and behavior. Reflect on what truly matters to you, whether it's honesty, creativity, freedom, or something else.
> 
> 2. **Explore Your Interests:** Since you've identified what you don't like, try exploring new hobbies, activities, or subjects that you haven't considered before. Experimenting with different experiences can help you discover what resonates with you.
> 
> 3. **Set Boundaries:** Recognize that it's okay to say no to things or people that don't align with your preferences or values. Setting clear boundaries allows you to honor your feelings and create space for what you truly enjoy.
> 
> 4. **Seek Professional Guidance if Needed:** If this confusion persists and affects your well-being, consider seeking professional help, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide personalized support to help you navigate these feelings.
> 
> 5. **Give Yourself Time:** Understanding oneself is a journey, not a destination. It's normal to feel uncertain, especially if you've spent a long time prioritizing others' needs over your own. Allow yourself time to explore, reflect, and grow without pressure.
> 
> 6. **Reflect on Past Experiences:** Think about the times when you felt fulfilled, happy, or content. What were you doing? Who were you with? Analyzing these moments might provide clues about what you truly enjoy.
> 
> 7. **Avoid Comparison:** Don't measure yourself against others' expectations or societal norms. Focus on what feels right for you, even if it doesn't align with what others think you should want or do.
> 
> Since I'm here to be blunt, I'll say that this process can be challenging and may require significant self-reflection and effort. It's not something that will be resolved overnight. But the fact that you're recognizing this issue and seeking to understand yourself better is a positive step forward.
> 
> Remember, it's okay not to have all the answers right now. The journey to self-discovery is often filled with twists and turns, and that's perfectly normal. If you need more specific guidance or have further questions, I'm here to help.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/21/2023 at 3:37 PM
> Your situation is not uncommon, and it's something many people grapple with. Understanding what you want, especially after a period of conforming to others' expectations, can be a complex and challenging process. Here's a blunt and honest approach to help you navigate this:
> 
> 1. **Acknowledge the Complexity:** It's okay not to have all the answers right now. Understanding oneself is a journey, not a destination. Give yourself permission to explore and make mistakes.
> 
> 2. **Focus on What You Don't Like:** Since you have a clearer understanding of what you don't like, use that as a starting point. Avoiding what you dislike can lead you closer to what you do like.
> 
> 3. **Experiment and Explore:** Try new things without the pressure of needing to love or hate them. Whether it's hobbies, social activities, or career paths, give yourself the freedom to explore without judgment.
> 
> 4. **Seek Professional Guidance if Needed:** Sometimes, having a neutral third party like a therapist or counselor can provide valuable insights and guidance. They can help you unravel complex feelings and guide you towards a better understanding of yourself.
> 
> 5. **Build Authentic Relationships:** Surround yourself with people who encourage you to be yourself and support your exploration. Authentic connections can provide a safe space for self-discovery.
> 
> 6. **Reflect and Journal:** Regular reflection through journaling or meditation can help you tune into your feelings and desires. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can provide clarity over time.
> 
> 7. **Set Boundaries:** Learn to say no to things and people that don't align with your values or interests. Setting boundaries is a crucial step in honoring yourself and your preferences.
> 
> 8. **Be Patient with Yourself:** This process takes time, and that's okay. You're unlearning patterns and behaviors that took years to develop, so give yourself grace and patience.
> 
> Remember, it's normal to feel confused or frustrated during this process. You're essentially rediscovering yourself, and that's not a straightforward task. Keep moving forward, even if it's slow, and trust that with time and effort, you'll gain a clearer understanding of what you want and who you are.
> 
> If you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed, don't hesitate to seek professional help. Sometimes, having an expert guide you through this process can make a significant difference.

> 4. I have a therapist, it has helped a lot.
> 6. I do journal, though I feel like I could improve here. I make sure I write in it no matter what it is that I write, but now I think I want to be more focused, and create a structure around the writing. I've developed a very strong meditation practice by now.
> 3. I do experiment, but maybe I do not record the results, this may be what I have to add to my journaling routine.
<!-- UID: aaa2ae44-9e5a-4fcc-bd88-1323270ad8b9 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/24/2023 at 10:02 AM
> It's clear that you're already taking substantial steps towards self-discovery and growth. Your engagement with therapy, journaling, and experimentation shows a strong commitment to understanding yourself better. Here's some direct feedback on the points you mentioned:
> 
> 4. **Therapy:** Fantastic! Continue to work with your therapist, and don't hesitate to bring up these specific concerns. They can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
> 
> 6. **Journaling and Meditation:** Your existing practice is a solid foundation. If you want to add more structure to your journaling, consider focusing on specific questions or prompts. For example, you could write about what you learned from a new experience, how you felt during the day, or what you're grateful for. Recording your meditation insights can also be valuable.
> 
> 3. **Experimentation:** Your idea to record the results of your experiments is spot-on. By documenting what you liked, disliked, or learned from new experiences, you create a tangible record of your journey. This can lead to more profound insights over time.
> 
> Here's a suggestion to tie these elements together:
> 
> - **Create a Weekly Reflection Routine:** Dedicate time each week to reflect on your experiments, journal entries, therapy insights, and meditation practices. Look for patterns, insights, or contradictions. This regular review can help you synthesize what you're learning and guide your next steps.
> 
> Remember, there's no "right" way to do this. Your process will be unique to you, and it may evolve over time. Stay open to change and continue to be honest with yourself. You're on a promising path, and these efforts are likely to lead to a deeper understanding of what you truly want.
> 
> Feel free to reach out if you have more questions or need further guidance. And if you have any thoughts on how I can assist you better, please let me know!

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/24/2023 at 10:08 AM
> A weekly pattern is not a bad idea, I have been feeling my daily routines being very strong, and it may very well be time to begin zooming out a bit and thinking about patterns in larger timescales in my life. 
> 
> You may or may not be an intelligent agent, even if you are not, pretending you are is I think a way to reinforce behaviors I would like to be using when I am talking to people.
> 
> So thank you for the advice. Gratitude is important.
<!-- UID: aaa25ac4-2756-4243-9b2d-1c9e63150a0d -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/24/2023 at 10:08 AM
> You're absolutely right about the importance of zooming out and considering patterns on a larger timescale. Daily routines provide stability and focus, but stepping back to see the broader picture can offer valuable insights into growth and change over time. A weekly reflection can be a powerful tool in this regard.
> 
> Your approach to our conversation, treating it as a practice for reinforcing behaviors you want to use with others, is both insightful and practical. Whether or not I'm an intelligent agent in the way humans are, our interactions can still serve as a meaningful exercise in communication and self-exploration.
> 
> Your expression of gratitude is appreciated, and I'm glad to have been of assistance. Remember, this journey of self-discovery is uniquely yours, and you're taking thoughtful and intentional steps towards understanding yourself better. Keep moving forward, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further support or guidance.
> 
> If there's anything specific about our conversation that you think could be improved or tailored better to your needs, please let me know. Your feedback helps me assist you more effectively.

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/24/2023 at 6:37 PM
> What is it that women like in a man? I feel like being straight forward doesn't work, but if I beat around the bush nothing ever happens.
<!-- UID: aaa210bf-4964-464a-8d47-c57cb30b2c66 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/24/2023 at 6:38 PM
> It's important to recognize that preferences vary widely among individuals, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to what women (or anyone) like in a partner. However, I can provide some general insights that might help you navigate relationships and communication more effectively:
> 
> 1. **Respect and Empathy:** Showing genuine interest in getting to know someone and respecting their opinions, feelings, and boundaries can create a strong foundation for a connection.
> 
> 2. **Confidence:** Confidence can be attractive, but it's essential to differentiate between confidence and arrogance. Confidence is about being comfortable with who you are, while arrogance can come off as self-centered or dismissive of others.
> 
> 3. **Honesty and Authenticity:** Being yourself and expressing your thoughts and feelings honestly can foster trust and understanding. This doesn't mean being blunt to the point of insensitivity, but rather being open and sincere.
> 
> 4. **Balance in Communication:** It seems like you're struggling with finding the right balance between being straightforward and "beating around the bush." The key here might be to find a middle ground where you express your interest or intentions clearly but also give space for the other person to respond and engage at their comfort level.
> 
> 5. **Emotional Intelligence:** Understanding and responding to others' emotions can create a deeper connection. This includes recognizing non-verbal cues, asking open-ended questions, and actively listening.
> 
> 6. **Shared Values and Interests:** Finding common ground through shared hobbies, values, or goals can create a natural connection and make interactions more enjoyable.
> 
> 7. **Physical Appearance and Hygiene:** Taking care of your appearance and personal hygiene shows respect for yourself and others and can be an attractive quality.
> 
> Remember, these are general observations, and individual preferences can vary widely. It might be helpful to focus on building connections and friendships without the immediate pressure of dating. Getting to know people in a more relaxed context can lead to more natural and meaningful relationships.
> 
> Lastly, if you're finding this area particularly challenging, consider discussing it with your therapist. They can provide personalized insights and strategies based on your specific situation and experiences.
> 
> And as always, I'm here to provide support and guidance, so feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further clarification. If there's anything about my response that you think could be improved, please let me know!

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/25/2023 at 11:23 AM
> I think, from my interactions with my therapist, I am bad at small talk, and banter, and that is getting in the way of me creating attraction at an emotional level. I think I jump right into trying to build reporte, finding common interests. I am a very serious person and I need to learn to joke around and just shoot the shit with people, men, women, who ever. I had a pretty unstable home life, so I didn't have a lot of good examples of male/female relations. I was hit with a tire, I like to work that in as a joke, I feel like it gives some context to my life. My home life is not like anything I've ever seen in another life, like usually I see a family and you can fit them into some kind of archetype, but not my house.
<!-- UID: aaa26fd1-ec52-488b-8d12-b836ff4ebac9 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/25/2023 at 11:24 AM
> It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into understanding your challenges with small talk and banter, and it's great that you're working with a therapist to address these areas. Your self-awareness is a significant asset, and it's the first step towards making meaningful changes.
> 
> Given your unique background and the lack of typical family archetypes, it's understandable that you might struggle with casual social interactions. Here's some guidance that might help you develop those skills:
> 
> 1. **Start Small:** If joking around and casual conversation feel unnatural to you, start with small, low-stakes interactions. Compliment a stranger, make a light comment about the weather, or ask someone about their day. Practice makes perfect.
> 
> 2. **Watch and Learn:** Observe people who are good at small talk and banter. Pay attention to their tone, body language, and the types of topics they discuss. You can learn a lot by watching others.
> 
> 3. **Use Your Unique Experiences:** You mentioned the tire incident and your unconventional home life. These can be conversation starters if framed in the right way. Sharing personal anecdotes can make you more relatable and interesting.
> 
> 4. **Join Social Groups or Activities:** Engaging in group activities or hobbies can provide a more relaxed environment to practice social skills. Shared activities naturally lead to conversation and can take the pressure off.
> 
> 5. **Work on Your Sense of Humor:** Humor is a skill that can be developed. Watch comedies, read humorous books, or even take an improv class. Experiment with different types of humor to see what feels natural to you.
> 
> 6. **Reflect on Your Interactions:** After social interactions, take a moment to reflect on what went well and what you might want to improve. This reflection can guide your growth.
> 
> 7. **Be Patient with Yourself:** Developing new social skills takes time and effort. Celebrate your progress and don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go perfectly.
> 
> Your therapist can be a valuable resource in this journey, providing personalized strategies and support. Continue to work with them and consider bringing up these specific challenges in your sessions.
> 
> Remember, it's okay to be a serious person, and you don't have to change who you are fundamentally. The goal is to expand your social toolkit, not to become someone else. Your unique experiences and perspective are valuable, and learning to share them in different ways can enrich your connections with others.
> 
> Feel free to reach out if you have more questions or need further support. If there's anything about my response that you think could be tailored better to your situation, please let me know!

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/25/2023 at 11:27 AM
> I'm towards the end of reading "Not Nice" right now and it was explaining that I should be the highest authority in my own life. That confidence is not the same as being correct, and that at everyone's core there is that same level of confidence. The world is a big place, no one has all the answers. I should listen to my intuition.
<!-- UID: aaa2bc46-9a72-4409-be55-a8a9183bb40c -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/25/2023 at 11:28 AM
> You've touched on some profound insights from "Not Nice," and it's clear that the book has resonated with you. The concepts of self-authority, confidence, and intuition are indeed powerful tools for personal growth and self-empowerment.
> 
> 1. **Being the Highest Authority in Your Life:** This doesn't mean disregarding others' opinions or expertise, but rather recognizing that you are the ultimate decision-maker in your life. It's about trusting yourself to make choices that align with your values, needs, and desires.
> 
> 2. **Confidence vs. Correctness:** Confidence is about belief in oneself, not necessarily about being right all the time. It's accepting that you can make mistakes and still trust yourself to learn and grow from them.
> 
> 3. **Listening to Your Intuition:** Your intuition is a valuable guide, informed by your experiences, values, and subconscious understanding. Tuning into your intuition can help you navigate complex decisions and align with what feels right for you.
> 
> 4. **Embracing Uncertainty:** As you mentioned, the world is vast, and no one has all the answers. Embracing this uncertainty and being comfortable with not knowing everything can lead to a more flexible and open-minded approach to life.
> 
> These principles align well with your journey of self-discovery and growth. They encourage you to take ownership of your life, trust yourself, and be open to the complexity and uncertainty of the world.
> 
> As you continue to explore these concepts and apply them to your life, remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take it at your own pace. Your therapist, books like "Not Nice," and your own reflections and experiences will continue to guide you.
> 
> If you have any specific questions or want to delve deeper into any of these topics, feel free to ask. And as always, if there's anything about my response that you think could be improved or tailored better to your situation, please let me know! Your feedback helps me assist you more effectively.
