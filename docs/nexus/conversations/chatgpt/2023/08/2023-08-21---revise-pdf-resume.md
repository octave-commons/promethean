> I think having a project section is a good idea. Do you think it is a good idea to mention that I was doing that in middle school, or should I just say I did it?
<!-- UID: aaa2e87e-c020-456a-91c2-0536ee3ceb10 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/21/2023 at 11:31 AM
> Aloha, Aaron! 🌺 Creating a project section is a fantastic idea, and it'll showcase your creativity and innovation.
> 
> As for mentioning that you were doing this in middle school, it's a personal choice, but here's my take:
> 
> - **Include Middle School Mention**
>  - **Pros:** It highlights your early passion and talent for technology. It's quite impressive to have accomplished such projects at a young age.
>  - **Cons:** Some recruiters might focus more on recent professional experience.
> 
> - **Exclude Middle School Mention**
>  - **Pros:** It keeps the focus on the projects themselves and what you achieved.
>  - **Cons:** You lose the context of having done this work at an unusually young age, which is a unique aspect of your story.
> 
> If you feel that the fact you were doing this in middle school adds to your story and shows your long-standing commitment to technology, then it's worth including. If you think it might distract from your more recent professional accomplishments, you might choose to leave it out.
> 
> What do you think? Your instincts will guide us in the right direction! 🌊 Let me know, and we'll get to work on those changes!

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/21/2023 at 11:33 AM
> I think presenting it first like it is currently is bad, but I think mentioning it is important. If the projects section is moved to the bottom, and if we briefly mention in the summary that I have been doing work in the field since I was in middle school might be a good idea.
<!-- UID: aaa236ad-bcb2-42d9-8c72-c6793e847d6f -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/21/2023 at 11:33 AM
> Aloha, Aaron! 🌺 I totally agree with your thoughts. Mentioning your early start in the field in the summary adds a unique touch to your story, and moving the projects section to the bottom keeps the focus on your recent professional experience.
> 
> Here's how we can make those changes:
> 
> 1. **Update Summary**
>  - **Modification:** Add a sentence like "My passion for technology began in middle school, where I contributed to game development and community revival projects."
>  - **Explanation:** This highlights your early start without overshadowing your recent accomplishments.
> 
> 2. **Create Projects Section**
>  - **Modification:** Move the game development details to a new Projects section at the bottom of the resume.
>  - **Explanation:** This organizes your resume and keeps the focus on your professional experience while still showcasing your creative projects.
> 
> 3. **Reorder Sections**
>  - **Modification:** Adjust the order of sections to flow from Summary to Skills, Experience, Education, and finally Projects.
>  - **Explanation:** This logical flow guides the reader through your career journey, ending with your unique projects.
> 
> Here's a summary of the changes:
> 
> | Item | Modification | Explanation |
> |------|--------------|-------------|
> | 1 | Update Summary with early start mention | Highlights early passion |
> | 2 | Create Projects section and move game development details | Organizes resume |
> | 3 | Reorder sections for logical flow | Enhances readability |
> 
> Let me know if you're good with these changes, and we'll get started on updating your resume. We're making it shine, just like a beautiful Hawaiian sunset! 🌅

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/21/2023 at 11:47 AM
> I'd like to expand on my work with the AI simulations. I specifically created an ant colony simulator implemented as a probabilistic cellular automata (PCA), another PCA which modeled the behavior of algae given a sun, nutrients, and water, and most recently took the ant idea, and turned it into a vector based system with great success. 
> 
> The PCA version of the ants put down pheromones which decayed over time, the ants were trying to find food in the form of plants that propagated to random tiles around them. The ants would also occationally create new colonies of ants with new base characteristics. Ant colonies had specialized kernels that would dictate how they followed the pheremones. New colonies would randomly select a food source based on the total number of entities of each species of ant, and total number of planes. Ants would eat other ants as the plants died out.
> 
> For the algae PCA, I was planning on adding it to the ant PCA but never got around to to it, and ultimately decided that the vector based ants were superior.
> 
> The vector based ants created very clear trails, they looked a hell of a lot like actual ant swarms, and they could navigate complicated landscapes to arrive at their goal.

Ant colonies had specialized kernels dictating pheromone-following behavior, with new colonies forming and adapting based on environmental factors. The simulation also included predatory behavior as ants would eat other ants when plants died out. 
> Algae Behavior Simulator (PCA): Modeled the growth and behavior of algae given sun, nutrients, and water. Initially planned to integrate with the ant simulation but later focused on vector-based ants. 
> Vector-Based Ant Simulation: Developed a more advanced ant simulation using vector-based systems, resulting in clear trails and realistic swarm behavior. The ants were able to navigate complex landscapes to reach their goals, reflecting a deep understanding of vector mathematics and biological systems.
> 
> **GAME DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY REVIVAL (DURING MIDDLE SCHOOL)** 
> Warcraft III Maps: While in middle school, played a key role in reviving and enhancing several Warcraft III map projects, collaborating with small teams and individual creators. 
> Fire Mechanics: Designed innovative game mechanics such as trees catching and spreading fire. 
> 3D Modeling: Contributed new 3D models. 
> World War III Game: Implemented advanced features like aircraft flight patterns, stealth aircraft, supply routes, refueling, and rearming. 
> Community Impact: Revived otherwise dead communities through active involvement and creative contributions.
