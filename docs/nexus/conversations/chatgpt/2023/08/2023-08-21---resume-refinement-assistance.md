>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/24/2023 at 4:10 PM
> Certainly, Aaron. Based on the job description for the Full Stack Engineer position at Kale, here's my brutally honest feedback on how your resume aligns with the requirements and expectations:
> 
> 1. **Relevance to the Role**: Your resume showcases a wide range of skills and experience in software development, but it doesn't specifically highlight your expertise in the technologies mentioned in the job description, such as Kotlin, React.js, GraphQL, and Spring. While you have experience with Java, React, and GraphQL, the resume doesn't emphasize your proficiency in these areas.
> 
> 2. **Tech Stack Alignment**: The job description emphasizes a specific tech stack, including Kotlin, React.js, Spring, and Postgres. Your resume mentions experience with Java, React, and GraphQL, but it doesn't mention Kotlin or Spring. If you have experience with these technologies, it would be beneficial to highlight them.
> 
> 3. **Startup Experience**: The "Nice to haves" section mentions professional experience at a software startup. Your resume doesn't specifically highlight any startup experience. If you have worked in a startup environment, it would be good to emphasize that.
> 
> 4. **Mentorship and Team Collaboration**: The job description emphasizes collaboration, mentorship, and team health. While your resume mentions pair programming and test-driven development, it might be beneficial to further emphasize your experience in mentoring, collaboration, and promoting best practices within a team.
> 
> 5. **Education**: The qualifications section mentions a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field. Your resume states that you are self-educated. While this is not necessarily a negative, it might be worth elaborating on your self-education to demonstrate how it equips you for the role.
> 
> 6. **Alignment with Company Mission**: The company's mission focuses on empowering people and redefining social commerce. Your resume doesn't specifically align with this mission. If you have relevant experience or a personal connection to this mission, it might be worth highlighting.
> 
> 7. **Proactive Approach**: You mentioned wanting to modernize their stack if they are using older versions of Java. While this shows initiative, it might be more effective to frame it as a willingness to contribute to continuous improvement and innovation rather than a specific intention to change their existing technologies.
> 
> 8. **Summary Section**: The revised summary section does a good job of highlighting your early aptitude for technology. However, it might be beneficial to tailor it further to align with the specific role at Kale, emphasizing your full-stack capabilities and alignment with their tech stack and mission.
> 
> In summary, while your resume showcases a strong background in software development, it could benefit from more specific alignment with the technologies, mission, and expectations outlined in the job description for Kale. Tailoring the resume to emphasize your experience with Kotlin, React.js, Spring, collaboration, mentorship, and alignment with the company's mission would likely make it more compelling for this particular role.
>

> I only have surface level knowledge of Kotlin. I would feel comfortable jumping into a job that required it though, as I understand it well enough to be able to work with it, it is a super set of java if I recall correctly, so I would be able to start working with it just writing plain old java. I do have experience with react, graphQL, Spring, and Postgres.I have experience with mentorship, on the knowledge management system I was working with an intern at raft. On that same project, I took total ownership of it when the deadline was set and it was clear that our intern was not comfortable with taking it to the level that our CTO wanted it to be. I have *a lot* of experience working at startups, every job referenced on my resume was a startup. I've worked at a startup through every phase of growth. Raft is currently in hyper growth, Unearthly entertainment was just getting started. Birdseed was some where in the middle, cloudapp was an interesting one, I don't think it was exactly hyper growth but it was pretty mature. They kept their company pretty lean.
