> It seems like you might be referring to some specific plugins or tools that I haven't been informed about. Could you please provide more details about the plugins you're referring to, or clarify what you're trying to achieve with them? That way, I can tailor my response to your needs and avoid any unnecessary explanations. If the plugins are related to software development or artificial intelligence, I'm here to help!

> Ah, I see! You're referring to the potential functionality for plugins with ChatGPT models. However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I don't have direct information about a specific beta or plugins being enabled for this model.
> 
> It's possible that new features have been released since my last update, and I'm unable to access real-time information to provide you with the latest details.
> 
> I would recommend checking the official documentation, release notes, or support forums associated with the product or service you're using. That's usually the best place to find accurate and up-to-date information on how to use new features like plugins.
> 
> If you have any questions related to software development, artificial intelligence, or the like, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you! Is there anything specific in those areas that you need help with or would like to know more about?
