> Alright, let's get straight to the point. What kind of job are you looking for? Do you want to stick with software engineering, specifically in the DoD contracting field, or are you open to exploring other areas? Let me know the job title, type (full-time, part-time, etc.), location, and any specific skills you want to emphasize, so I can find the most relevant opportunities for you.

> Got it. You're aiming for high-level positions. Let's narrow it down a bit more:
> 
> 1. **Location**: Are you looking for opportunities in a specific city or state, or are you open to remote positions?
> 2. **Job Type**: Full-time, part-time, contract, etc. What's your preference?
> 3. **Skills**: Any specific technologies or methodologies you want to highlight? Your experience with DoD contracts and software factories might be a strong selling point.
> 
> Give me these details, and I'll find the jobs that match your criteria.
