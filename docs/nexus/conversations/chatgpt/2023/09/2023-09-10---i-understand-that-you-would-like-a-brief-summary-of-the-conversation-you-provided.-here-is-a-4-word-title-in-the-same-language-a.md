> I'm going to be direct here; your dating profile is a mishmash of various philosophical quotes, popular culture references, and personal desires. It's quite chaotic and doesn't really give a solid sense of who you are or what you are truly looking for in a partner, besides the specific preference mentioned at the beginning.
> 
> While expressing your interest in philosophy and pop culture can potentially attract like-minded individuals, it might also be beneficial to provide a bit more grounded information about yourself. You know, something tangible that would allow potential matches to connect with you on a deeper level. 
> 
> Moreover, your initial line might be perceived as quite specific and possibly exclusionary, which could limit your pool of potential matches significantly. It might be more beneficial to create an opening line that is welcoming to a wider audience, while still maintaining your personality and interests.
> 
> Remember, the goal here is to showcase yourself in a manner that's both true to who you are and inviting to potential partners. 
> 
> Would you like any advice on how to adjust your profile or incorporate elements that might resonate more broadly with potential matches?

> What do you mean by grounded and tangible?

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 09/10/2023 at 11:09 AM
> By "grounded and tangible," I mean including information that paints a clearer picture of who you are as a person, and what a relationship with you might be like. Your current profile leans heavily on abstract and philosophical notions, which, while intriguing, doesn't offer a concrete sense of your personality, hobbies, interests, or lifestyle.
> 
> For example, you might want to share what you do for a living, your hobbies, what you like to do on weekends, what kind of relationship you are looking for, etc. Adding these details would give potential matches a more rounded view of you, facilitating deeper connections.
> 
> You don't have to abandon the philosophical and pop culture references altogether; they can still be a part of your profile to add flavor and showcase your interests. However, mixing them with more straightforward information about yourself could create a more balanced and engaging profile.

> I have been disconnected from this part of myself for a long time. I made it abstract, because I'm abstract. What do I do on the weekends? I read the books I got the references from, watch the shows, etc

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 09/10/2023 at 11:14 AM
> I see, it sounds like you're in a phase of rediscovery and your interests are heavily intertwined with the abstract and philosophical realms. 
> 
> Given this, it might be a good strategy to start a conversation with potential matches right in your profile, encouraging them to engage with you on these abstract topics. For instance, you might pose a thought-provoking question or suggest a discussion topic based on one of your favorite philosophical texts or shows.
> 
> Moreover, since you're interested in the abstract and often find yourself immersed in books and shows during weekends, why not detail this a bit more in your profile? You might say something like "On weekends, you can find me immersed in the rich worlds found within ancient texts, or dissecting the latest episodes of [insert favorite show here]. I value deep conversations that challenge my perspective and inspire growth."
> 
> Remember, your profile is a dynamic entity. As you rediscover yourself and perhaps develop new interests or hobbies, don't hesitate to update your profile to reflect the evolving "you". The most important thing is to remain true to yourself, and communicate in a way that feels natural and authentic to you.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 09/10/2023 at 11:18 AM
> I hear you; it sounds like you're experiencing a disconnect between the people you're attracting and the people you're interested in forming a relationship with. You want to connect with individuals who not only stimulate your mind but also meet your criteria in terms of physical attraction and mental stability.
> 
> Since your profile is abstract, it might be attracting people who strongly identify with the abstract and philosophical themes you've presented, but who might not align with your other preferences.
> 
> Being more explicit about your desires and the kind of relationship you are looking for might help in this situation. It's perfectly okay to have standards and to want a partner who matches your level of investment in personal health and well-being. 
> 
> Given your clear stance on not being desperate and wanting a mutually enriching relationship, you might consider reworking your profile to be a bit more balanced, including hints of your physical activity or hints of your lifestyle that indicate your mental stability and grounded nature. 
> 
> A potential profile snippet might read something like, "Physically active and mentally grounded, I value deep conversations and a healthy lifestyle. I am in search of someone who shares a zest for intellectual exploration as well as a commitment to personal well-being."
> 
> Remember, the goal here is to clearly communicate your desires and boundaries, attracting individuals who align with your values and preferences. Would you like assistance in crafting a more balanced profile that communicates this?

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 09/10/2023 at 11:20 AM
> Absolutely, the profile picture can be a significant factor in online dating. It's often the first thing people notice, and it can heavily influence someone's decision to engage with your profile further or not. 
> 
> A high-quality, clear photo where you are presented well (dressed nicely, smiling, etc.) can have a positive impact. It might also be beneficial to have pictures that subtly hint at your interests and lifestyle - maybe a picture of you holding a favorite book, or one from a hike or workout session to showcase your active lifestyle.
> 
> I would also recommend avoiding pictures where you might look unapproachable or overly serious, as they might not convey the inviting and engaging persona you're aiming for.
> 
> If you're open to it, you might consider getting feedback from friends or family on your profile picture to ensure it presents you in the best possible light. Would you like tips on what kind of photos generally perform well on dating platforms?

> I have been told selfies do not play well, they say I don't have friends.
<!-- UID: c22159cf-5ba3-4aaa-ab4e-08b6efcac902 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 09/10/2023 at 11:20 AM
> That's a fairly common perception. While selfies aren't inherently bad, they can sometimes give off the impression of being a bit solitary, especially if your profile contains only selfies. 
> 
> To circumvent this, you might consider including photos where you are socializing with others or engaged in activities that you enjoy, as these can showcase more dimensions of your personality and interests. It can indicate a sociable nature and a vibrant personal life. 
> 
> If you have photos where you're outdoors, at an event, or participating in a hobby, those might play well. These pictures don't necessarily have to include other people, but a variety in your pictures can paint a more rounded picture of who you are.
> 
> If taking new photos with friends is not an option, even photos where you are alone but clearly out and about doing something interesting can be a good addition. It showcases a bit of your life and interests, adding depth to your profile.
> 
> Remember, the key is to authentically represent yourself while also considering the potential perceptions of those viewing your profile. Would you like assistance in formulating a strategy to update your profile pictures effectively?
