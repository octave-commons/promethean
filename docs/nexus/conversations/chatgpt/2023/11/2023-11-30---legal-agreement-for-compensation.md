> My friend did a very big favor for me today and I have made an agreement with him that in about 6 months I will buy him a car and some starting capital for a business. 6 months is about how long I think it will take before my business makes a profit. We agreed the total value of compensation will be 5000 dollars. What ever is not used to buy a car is to be transferred to a BTC, ETH, or XMR wallet I will help him set up if he is unable to himself. He is a very close friend of mine. He helped me jump my car and move it before it was towed. He would have trusted me with out a contract but I wanted to be held accountable. I want to draft up a legally binding document facilitating this agreement with actions he can take if I do not keep my word.
