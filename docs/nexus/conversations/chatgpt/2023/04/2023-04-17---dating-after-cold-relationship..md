> Starting to date again after being in an emotionally cold relationship can be a challenging process, but there are steps you can take to make it easier on yourself:
> 
> 1. Take time to heal: Before you jump into dating, take some time to heal from your previous relationship. Allow yourself to process your emotions, reflect on what went wrong, and work on building your self-esteem.
> 
> 2. Focus on self-care: Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself. This could include exercise, spending time with friends, pursuing hobbies, or seeking therapy.
> 
> 3. Be clear about what you want: Reflect on what you want in a relationship and communicate those desires to potential partners. This could include wanting emotional intimacy, trust, and communication.
> 
> 4. Be open to vulnerability: Being vulnerable is an important part of building emotional intimacy with a partner. It can be scary, but it is necessary for a healthy relationship.
> 
> 5. Take things slow: Don't rush into anything. Take the time to get to know a person before jumping into a relationship.
> 
> 6. Trust your instincts: If something doesn't feel right, trust your instincts. You don't have to force yourself to be in a relationship with someone just because you're trying to move on from a previous one.
> 
> Remember, everyone's journey is different, and it's important to take things at your own pace. Focus on what you need to do to take care of yourself, and eventually, you'll find someone who is a good match for you.

> Feeling nervous around people and not knowing what to say can be a common experience for many people. Here are a few tips to help you feel more confident in social situations:
> 
> 1. Prepare ahead of time: If you're attending a social event, think ahead of time about some topics you can bring up to start a conversation. This can help you feel more prepared and confident.
> 
> 2. Ask open-ended questions: Instead of asking closed-ended questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," try asking open-ended questions that require more of a response. This can help keep the conversation flowing and encourage the other person to open up.
> 
> 3. Practice active listening: Pay attention to what the other person is saying and ask follow-up questions to show that you're engaged in the conversation. This can help you feel more connected to the other person and keep the conversation going.
> 
> 4. Be yourself: Don't try to be someone you're not in order to impress others. Authenticity is attractive, and being yourself can help you feel more confident and comfortable in social situations.
> 
> 5. Take deep breaths: If you feel yourself getting nervous or anxious, take a few deep breaths to help calm your nerves.
> 
> Remember, it's okay to feel nervous around people. Try to be kind to yourself and take small steps to build your confidence over time. With practice, you can learn to feel more comfortable and confident in social situations.
