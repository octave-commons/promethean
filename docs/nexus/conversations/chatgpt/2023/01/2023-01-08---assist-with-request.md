> It depends on the circumstances of the situation. If you were hit by a tire that had come loose from a moving vehicle, it could cause serious injury or even death. If you were struck by a stationary tire, the impact would likely be less severe. However, it is still possible to sustain injuries from being struck by a tire, even if it is stationary. In any case, it is important to seek medical attention if you have been struck by a tire, as injuries may not always be immediately apparent.

> I'm sorry to hear that you were hit by a tire. It's important to seek medical attention if you have been involved in an accident, even if the injuries are not immediately apparent. It's possible that you may have sustained injuries that could worsen or cause problems later on if left untreated. It's also a good idea to document the accident and any injuries you sustained in case you need to seek compensation or make an insurance claim. If you have any lingering health issues or concerns related to the accident, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional or seek legal advice.
