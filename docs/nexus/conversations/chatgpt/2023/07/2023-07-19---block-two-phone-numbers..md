> As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific network configurations or the ability to interact with real-world systems. However, I can provide some general information that may help you understand the concept.
> 
> Blocking connections to two phone numbers from both ends depends on the context and the network or communication system involved. Here are a couple of interpretations based on different scenarios:
> 
> 1. **Telecommunication Services**: If you want to block communication between two specific phone numbers in a telecommunication network (e.g., mobile or landline), it's typically not possible for an individual user to do so directly. Instead, you would need to contact your service provider and request them to block the communication between those two numbers.
> 
> 2. **Software Applications**: If you are referring to blocking connections between two phone numbers in a software application or a messaging platform, it would depend on the features provided by the application. Some messaging apps might allow you to block specific contacts or restrict communication between certain users.
> 
> It's essential to note that blocking communication from both ends means preventing any kind of communication, such as phone calls, text messages, or internet-based communication (e.g., messaging apps). This kind of action usually requires authorization from the relevant network or application administrators.
> 
> If you have a specific context or scenario in mind, I recommend reaching out to the appropriate service providers or consulting with network administrators for more detailed guidance on how to achieve the desired blocking.
