> As of my last update in September 2021, there was no specific information about a language model called "Nanogpt." It's possible that developments have occurred since then, and new models might have been introduced.
> 
> If "Nanogpt" refers to a language model released or developed after my last update, I would not have information on it. To learn about the latest advancements and developments in the field of AI, including new language models, I recommend checking more recent sources, academic papers, or official announcements from organizations working in the AI research domain.
