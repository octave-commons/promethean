> Discussing cultural or national ethics can be complex as it's intertwined with historical, social, and religious aspects. Saudi Arabia is known for its conservative Islamic culture and its adherence to a strict interpretation of Sharia law. Here are some key points regarding ethics and social norms in Saudi Arabia:
> 
> 1. **Religious Observance**: The practice and respect for Islamic traditions and laws are central to Saudi Arabian life. This includes daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, and adherence to dietary restrictions.
>  
> 2. **Gender Segregation**: Traditionally, there is a strict separation between unrelated men and women in public spaces. Though recent reforms have lessened this segregation to some extent, it remains a notable aspect of Saudi social ethics.
> 
> 3. **Dress Code**: Modesty in clothing is crucial. Women are required to wear an abaya (a loose-fitting black cloak) in public, while men wear a thobe (an ankle-length white robe).
> 
> 4. **Respect for Authority and Elders**: Hierarchical structures are respected, whether in the family, workplace, or in social settings. Elders and those in positions of authority are treated with a high level of respect.
> 
> 5. **Hospitality and Politeness**: Saudis are known for their hospitality and politeness, which are considered ethical imperatives. 
> 
> 6. **Business Ethics**: In business settings, relationships and trust are crucial. Business dealings often start with personal relationships and may take time to develop.
> 
> Understanding these aspects is essential, especially if one is to engage in professional or personal interactions within Saudi Arabian society or with Saudi individuals. Would these ethical aspects have a specific bearing on the system we are planning?
