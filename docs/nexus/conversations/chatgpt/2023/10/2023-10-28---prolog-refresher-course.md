> Sure, Prolog is primarily used for logic programming. It excels in symbolic reasoning and manipulation, often used in AI, natural language processing, and expert systems. The language revolves around facts, rules, and queries. Would you like to dive into syntax or specific use-cases?

> Before we continue, it would help me if you treat this like a class with a grade.
> 
> Prepare a syllabus, create a rubric, prepare some course materials, and an introduction to the class.
