> The representation of Irish individuals and entities in venture capital funding appears to be on an upward trajectory rather than being underrepresented. Various reports and data show an increasing amount of venture capital funding being directed towards Irish firms and tech start-ups in recent years:
> 
> 1. In the first half of 2023, Irish tech companies raised a record €963 million in VC funding, as reported by the Irish Venture Capital Association (IVCA)【9†source】.
> 2. In 2020, Irish Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) secured EUR 820 million in venture capital, marking an 11% increase compared to the previous year【11†source】.
> 3. Venture capital funding for Irish technology start-ups and SMEs reached a record €1.3 billion in 2021【12†source】.
> 4. A state agency, Enterprise Ireland, which backs indigenous Irish exporters, has been active in venture capital investments, indicating a supportive ecosystem for venture capital funding in Ireland【10†source】.
> 
> These figures and the involvement of state agencies in venture capital investments suggest that Irish firms are not underrepresented in this domain, but rather, are seeing a growth in venture capital funding.

> to be on an upward trend, indicating a positive development in their engagement with venture capital (VC) funding. Here's a breakdown based on the data retrieved from various sources:
> 
> 1. **Recent Funding Figures**:
>  - Irish small and medium-sized companies raised €502 million in capital funding in the first quarter of a specified year, which was an increase from €380 million in the preceding period【9†source】.
>  - In the first half of 2023, Irish tech companies secured over €963 million in VC funding, as reported by the Irish Venture Capital Association (IVCA)【9†source】.
>  - Venture capital funding for Irish technology start-ups and SMEs reached a record €1.3 billion in 2021【12†source】.
> 
> 2. **Yearly Growth**:
>  - The amount of venture capital raised by Irish SMEs increased to EUR 820 million in 2020, marking an 11% increase on 2019 figures, continuing a growth trend from the previous year【11†source】.
> 
> 3. **State Support**:
>  - Enterprise Ireland, a state agency backing indigenous Irish exporters, has been notably active in the venture capital scene, showcasing a strong support structure for Irish enterprises engaging in venture capital activities【10†source】.
> 
> This information suggests a growing engagement of Irish entities in venture capital funding, supported by both state and private sector investments. However, to definitively categorize the Irish as an underrepresented group in this domain, a comparative analysis with other regions or groups would be necessary. Additionally, historical data and a deeper dive into the demographic specifics of the venture capital sector in Ireland and abroad could provide a more nuanced understanding.

> The term "underrepresented groups" in venture capital (VC) funding seems to be more of an industry term rather than a strictly legal one. It generally refers to groups of individuals who historically have had less access to venture capital funding due to systemic barriers. Commonly recognized underrepresented groups in this context include Black, Latinx, Native American, and female founders【8†(Built In)】【9†(GPB)】【11†(UMich News)】.
> 
> There isn't a specific legal definition of "underrepresented groups" in venture capital funding, at least not in the federal regulations defining venture capital funds【10†(Cornell Law School)】. The information about venture capital funds in federal law focuses more on the structure and operations of the funds rather than on the demographics of the founders they invest in.
> 
> In the context of VC funding, the discussion around underrepresentation often revolves around broader societal barriers, such as access to initial capital, networks, and resources which are essential for entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups to succeed【11†(UMich News)】.
> 
> This information might be useful in understanding the broader dynamics of representation in venture capital funding. Now, regarding the representation of Irish individuals or groups in venture capital, shall we proceed to explore that?
