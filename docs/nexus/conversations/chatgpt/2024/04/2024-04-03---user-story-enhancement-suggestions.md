> Based on the key elements you've provided (Connextra format, Definition of Done (DoD), and Tasks), here's an AI prompt template for creating user stories:
> 
> ```
> AI Prompt Template for Creating User Stories:
> 
> Introduction:
> "Generate a comprehensive user story that aligns with the agile development process, ensuring it encapsulates the user's needs, the desired functionality, and the criteria for acceptance. This user story should serve as a clear guide for the development team to deliver value to the user."
> 
> 1. User Story (Connextra Format):
> "As a [type of user], I want [some feature or functionality] so that [benefit or value derived]."
> 
> 2. Definition of Done (DoD):
> "List the criteria that must be met for this user story to be considered complete. This should include quality standards, functional and non-functional requirements, and any other conditions that align with the team's and stakeholders' expectations."
> 
> 3. Tasks:
> "Break down the user story into specific, actionable tasks that need to be completed to achieve the desired outcome. Each task should be clear and concise, providing a roadmap for the development team."
> 
> 4. Acceptance Criteria:
> "Specify the conditions under which the user story is accepted as done. This should include detailed scenarios and outcomes that validate the functionality and performance of the feature or functionality described in the user story."
> 
> Example:
> - User Story: "As a frequent flyer, I want to select my seat during the booking process so that I can ensure my travel comfort."
> - Definition of Done: "User story is considered done when the seat selection feature is fully integrated into the booking process, has undergone thorough testing with no critical bugs, and has received approval from the product owner."
> - Tasks:
>  - Implement a seat selection option in the booking interface.
>  - Update the database to reflect seat availability in real-time.
>  - Conduct usability testing to ensure the feature is intuitive and user-friendly.
> - Acceptance Criteria:
>  - Given a user is booking a flight, when they reach the seat selection stage, then they should be able to view available seats and select their preference.
>  - Given a user has selected a seat, when they complete the booking, then the selected seat should be reserved for them.
> 
> End of Prompt.
> ```
> 
> This template incorporates the Connextra format for structuring the user story, outlines the Definition of Done to ensure clarity on when the story is completed, breaks down the story into specific tasks for actionable steps, and defines acceptance criteria for validating the story's completion[3][7][8][16].

> Your AI prompt template for creating user stories is well-structured and covers essential elements for crafting effective user stories within an agile development process. However, incorporating a few improvements could enhance clarity, ensure alignment with Scrum principles, and provide additional guidance for users unfamiliar with some concepts. Here are my suggestions for refinement:
> 
> 1. **Introduction Enhancement**:
>  - Include a brief explanation of the purpose and importance of user stories in the Scrum framework. This helps to set the stage for why the following sections are necessary.
> 
> 2. **Refinement to the Connextra Format**:
>  - Although the Connextra format is a good starting point, consider emphasizing the importance of focusing on the value or outcome for the user. This could involve a prompt for the author to think deeply about the benefit section to ensure it truly captures the value provided to the user.
> 
> 3. **Expansion on the Definition of Done (DoD)**:
>  - Suggest adding a reminder that the DoD should be agreed upon by the entire Scrum Team to reflect a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete. Reference to the latest Scrum Guide can be beneficial here for teams unfamiliar with the concept.
> 
> 4. **Tasks Section Clarification**:
>  - Encourage breaking down tasks into even smaller, more manageable pieces if they seem too complex. This can help in estimating effort more accurately and in identifying potential obstacles early on.
>  - Mention that tasks should be created and maintained by the developers as they are the ones turning the User Stories into increments of value.
> 
> 5. **Detailed Guidance on Acceptance Criteria**:
>  - Highlight the need for acceptance criteria to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). This ensures that everyone has a clear understanding of when the story is completed satisfactorily.
>  - It could be beneficial to suggest including both functional and non-functional criteria to ensure comprehensive coverage of what is expected from the feature.
> 
> 6. **Inclusion of Examples and Templates**:
>  - While one example is provided, offering multiple examples or templates for different types of user stories could be valuable. This would give users more context and variety, aiding in understanding how to adapt the template to their specific needs.
> 
> 7. **Scrum Guide Reference**:
>  - Since your template draws on Scrum methodologies, include a reference to the latest Scrum Guide (2020) for users to consult for more detailed guidance on creating user stories within the Scrum framework. This aligns with best practices and ensures that the information remains up-to-date with Scrum's evolution.
> 
> Example Revision:
> - **Introduction Enhancement**: "This template is designed to help Scrum Teams effectively articulate user needs and expectations through user stories. User stories are vital for understanding the user's perspective and ensuring the development process aligns with delivering tangible value."
> 
> By incorporating these improvements, your AI prompt template will be more comprehensive, better aligned with Scrum principles, and more useful to users across various levels of familiarity with Scrum and user story creation.

> Here's a revised version of the AI prompt template for creating user stories, incorporating the suggested improvements:
> 
> ---
> 
> **AI Prompt Template for Creating Enhanced User Stories in Agile Development:**
> 
> **Introduction:**
> "Begin by generating a user story that encapsulates the needs and expectations of the user, aligning with the Scrum framework to guide the development team towards delivering significant value. User stories are a fundamental component of the Scrum process, offering a concise, user-focused framework for understanding what the user values. This template aims to ensure clarity, shared understanding, and effective communication within the Scrum Team and stakeholders."
> 
> 1. **User Story (Enhanced Connextra Format):**
> "As a [type of user], I want [some feature or functionality] so that [benefit or value derived]. When crafting your user story, concentrate on the benefit or value derived, ensuring it clearly articulates the impact on the user."
> 
> 2. **Definition of Done (DoD):**
> "Define the specific criteria that signify the user story's completion, encompassing quality standards, functional and non-functional requirements, and other conditions set by the team and stakeholders. This shared understanding of completion, agreed upon by the entire Scrum Team, is crucial for maintaining alignment and quality."
> 
> 3. **Tasks:**
> "Detail specific, actionable tasks necessary to accomplish the desired outcome of the user story. Each task should be sufficiently granular to provide clear guidance to the development team. Remember, tasks should emerge from the developers themselves as they translate user stories into increments of value, ensuring a realistic roadmap for implementation."
> 
> 4. **Acceptance Criteria (with SMART Guidelines):**
> "Outline clear, specific conditions under which the user story is deemed complete. Criteria should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), encompassing both functional and non-functional aspects to thoroughly validate the feature's functionality and performance."
> 
> **Example (with Multiple Templates):**
> - **User Story:** "As a frequent flyer, I want to select my seat during the booking process so that I can ensure my travel comfort."
> - **Definition of Done:** "The story is complete when the seat selection feature is seamlessly integrated into the booking system, thoroughly tested for usability and functionality with no critical bugs, and approved by the Product Owner."
> - **Tasks:**
>  - Implement a user-friendly seat selection option in the booking interface.
>  - Update the database system to reflect seat availability accurately in real-time.
>  - Perform usability testing with real users to ensure the feature's intuitiveness.
> - **Acceptance Criteria:**
>  - Given a user is booking a flight, when they reach the seat selection stage, they can view and select from available seats.
>  - Given a user has selected a seat, when they complete the booking, their chosen seat is confirmed and reserved for their flight.
> 
> **Additional Resources:**
> For further guidance on creating effective user stories within the Scrum framework, refer to the latest [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). This resource offers comprehensive insights into Scrum principles, including the creation and management of user stories.
> 
> **End of Prompt.**
> 
> ---
> 
> This revised template provides a more detailed and guided approach to crafting user stories, with an emphasis on clarity, value to the user, and alignment with Scrum practices. By including enhanced descriptions, SMART acceptance criteria, and a reference to the Scrum Guide, it aims to be a more useful tool for teams of varying familiarity with agile methodologies.
