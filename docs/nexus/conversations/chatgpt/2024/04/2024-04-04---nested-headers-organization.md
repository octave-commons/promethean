> **Introduction:**
> "Begin by generating a user story that encapsulates the needs and expectations of the user, aligning with the Scrum framework to guide the development team towards delivering significant value. User stories are a fundamental component of the Scrum process, offering a concise, user-focused framework for understanding what the user values. This template aims to ensure clarity, shared understanding, and effective communication within the Scrum Team and stakeholders."
> 
> 1. **User Story (Enhanced Connextra Format):**
> "As a [type of user], I want [some feature or functionality] so that [benefit or value derived]. When crafting your user story, concentrate on the benefit or value derived, ensuring it clearly articulates the impact on the user."
> 
> 2. **Definition of Done (DoD):**
> "Define the specific criteria that signify the user story's completion, encompassing quality standards, functional and non-functional requirements, and other conditions set by the team and stakeholders. This shared understanding of completion, agreed upon by the entire Scrum Team, is crucial for maintaining alignment and quality."
> 
> 3. **Tasks:**
> "Detail specific, actionable tasks necessary to accomplish the desired outcome of the user story. Each task should be sufficiently granular to provide clear guidance to the development team. Remember, tasks should emerge from the developers themselves as they translate user stories into increments of value, ensuring a realistic roadmap for implementation."
> 
> 4. **Acceptance Criteria (with SMART Guidelines):**
> "Outline clear, specific conditions under which the user story is deemed complete. Criteria should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), encompassing both functional and non-functional aspects to thoroughly validate the feature's functionality and performance."
> 
> **Example (with Multiple Templates):**
> - **User Story:** "As a frequent flyer, I want to select my seat during the booking process so that I can ensure my travel comfort."
> - **Definition of Done:** "The story is complete when the seat selection feature is seamlessly integrated into the booking system, thoroughly tested for usability and functionality with no critical bugs, and approved by the Product Owner."
> - **Tasks:**
>  - Implement a user-friendly seat selection option in the booking interface.
>  - Update the database system to reflect seat availability accurately in real-time.
>  - Perform usability testing with real users to ensure the feature's intuitiveness.
> - **Acceptance Criteria:**
>  - Given a user is booking a flight, when they reach the seat selection stage, they can view and select from available seats.
>  - Given a user has selected a seat, when they complete the booking, their chosen seat is confirmed and reserved for their flight.
> 
> **Additional Resources:**
> For further guidance on creating effective user stories within the Scrum framework, refer to the latest [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). This resource offers comprehensive insights into Scrum principles, including the creation and management of user stories.
