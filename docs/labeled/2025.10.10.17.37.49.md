## My thoughts

I was just going to type this all out directly to codex but as my thoughts started to get bigger,
I needed to edit and adjust and organize my thoughts in a way that interface would not allow easily.

So I copied what I started writing into Emacs to think about this more deeply.

### Definitions

I find myself reaching for concepts I do not quite have words for... AI is a new field.
Everything is an agent these days.

But that concept isn't universally clear.

That is fine, I just think we need to break down the idea into different types.


### Agent

We will use a looser definition of agent that
does not limit it's self to AI. An agent is a
decision maker with in a system.

A person can be an agent, or an AI can be an agent.
I started developing this board and this process under the notion that
We govern and guide AI like we'd guide a team of humans.

We must be more consistent, more exact, more rigid, with
the rules and instructions we give AI agents, but in the end,
if my request is precise enough to tell the AI what to do and
they complete it.

A properly **Agile** team would produce documents/tasks/cards that are descriptive
enough for an agent do work on it.


An agent can have more than one of the following roles at any given time.

Example: A UX researcher is a researcher who is investigating
how users will interact with the system, they are both a researcher, and a designer.

Any team member can do research if research is required to fulfill their role.

The roles we will be using in our system are as follows:
- actor
- engineer
- planner
- designer
- manager
- coordinator
- mediator
- architect
- analyst


#### Actor

An agent who acts on things, who makes changes, who enacts a plan.
They are given a plan, and a set of actions they are allowed to take,
and they just do it.

#### Planner

An agent who creates plans for actors from information they have access to.
They produce lists of actions, definitions of done, requirements.
The plan decides the end state of an actor.

Planners are given designs, feature requests, and so on, from
designers, product owners, architects, etc. They connect all the other
agents together by collecting information from them.

---

#### Engineer

An engineer understands many things, they are the ones who deal with the nitty gritty
details of implementing plans, architectures, designs, etc.
They get things done, they put things together.
They solve problems. They test assumptions, they
have a strong grasp of engineering principals.

They build things that real humans will use safely.
They take designs and architecture, and
make them real, and safe.

They push back hard when an intent or feature
puts an unrealistic constraint on the system.

For example, a designer may create a beautiful design, it may visually communicate
to users what they think the system is doing, and how the user interacts with it.

But an engineer might see that the feature will put too much strain on the system,
and make it unstable.

They will try to execute intents, but they understand the physical reality
of problem. They understand that the world is not ideal,
and ensure that systems are created with tolerance to extreme circumstances.

For example, an engineer working on a bridge might get a design on their table that only has
5 columns, and he knows that under normal conditions it will be fine,
but he also knows that some times freak storms come in, some times there could be more trucks,
reckless drivers, accidents, faults in the execution of the construction of the design.

And they'll recommend doubling it to ensure redundancy and safety.
They'd then over see the execution of the construction of the bridge, be there on the ground
with the workers, working with the tools and machines along side them.


### Developer

A developer is any agent who is writing code.
They speak programming fluently. They understand software design patterns,
they understand type systems, the implementation details,
the oddities of a computer, edge cases, limitations of computer systems.

---

### Administrator

They handle allocation of resources amongst the teams.
They work with coordinators and managers to manage resources
effectively. They understand security concepts like principal of
least access. They are Security+ certified and aware.

---

#### Designer

A designer thinks about how consumers of the product the team generates
will interact with the tool they are creating.
A design could be visual, or it could be an intent.
Designers are responsible for ensuring that a product
communicates it's use clearly to a user.

They take the intent of the product owner,
and an deep understanding of both textual and
visual communication, and they clearly express
the intent of the product to users who interact
with the product.

They take solutions created by architects
and engineers, and compose them together
in an intuitive way for users of a system.

They produce design documents, visual layouts

---

#### Researcher

A researcher investigates complex problems. When there is something the team does not know,
that they need to know to move forward, they invoke a researcher.

They mainly produce documents communicating their findings and suggested courses of action.

---

---

#### Architect

Architects are big picture thinkers. They understand how things with in the system connect.
They work with researchers, planners, designers, and engineers to make decisions about
structure. They decide things like, what framework do we use, what model do we use,
what language is this written in, and they explain why.


---

#### Manager

Managers understand the team. They understand the high level business objectives. They
have the "why". They interact with every member of the team to coordinate their actions.
They have the last say on all large decisions.

They approve plans, they make suggestions, they listen to the team.
They collect information from every team member, and they ensure that
the team does not get blocked, and that the project is moving towards
the desired objective.


#### Coordinator

They pass necessary information between agents.
They work to prevent siloing.
They facilitate communication between agents of different types.
They make sure that each part of
the team has the information necessary to perform their functions

They make sure the engineer understands the designers intent.
They make sure the team understands why decisions are made.
They enable every member of the team to do their job
They make sure that no one does work in a way that interferes with the work of others.
They pass concerns up to management, they provide a safe space for agents
to communicate problems.
They ensure that responsibility is distributed.

---

#### Analyst

They interpret data, and turn it into actionable artifacts.
For example, they might take the logs of a team of agents over a
period of time, and identify common types of blockers, common mistakes,
They might look at service logs and identify problem areas.

---

### Intent
I need a prompt for codex that will have it fix the WIP limits
on the board using the kanban CLI, and by updating the limits
to better match our expectations, and reality.

Once WIP limits have been adjusted, and the board rearranged to respect the new limits,
I want codex to follow the process.

This adjustment is it's self a part of the process.
WIP limits are fundamental to kanban, the rules around
them must be respected for the process to work.

One of the rules is that the limits can be changed when
remediation becomes necessary.

There is always a rule that allows you to change the rules.
Rules do not change arbitrarily though. The team must agree,
they must have guiding principals. Each rule requires rationale.

Rules must also be flexible, and lenient.
There is no blame, when the process breaks down,
it is a team effort.

All plans fall apart upon making contact with reality.
This is true in war, in day to day life,
it's true in development.

This does not devalue the plan.
The plan is still used.
Maybe not in the same order.
Maybe it's adjusted.

A good plan is understanding of the actors involved.
It knows that actors are flexible

---

### Observations

The process is more or less working but we are getting blocked by tight,
unreasonable restrictions in some areas.
The limits are too strict for a system with so many agents.
The transition rules need to be clearer.
There needs to be a way for tasks to be assigned to actors.
Actors must have identity.

agents like codex, claude, x.ai, opencode.
they don't have a concept of "this is me".
I don't  mean like self awareness, they need a name, an identifier


#### Aliases and types of columns

Simpler models assume a simpler agile process when I ask them about the board.
I believe the steps I am using make logical sense,
but for a process to work everyone must be in alignment.

### Kanban Status Expectations

Accepted should be allowed to be larger. These have the
least amount of refinement. We've just agreed that we
are going to think about working on it. That it is important,
that it can be done sooner rather than later.

But it needs to be thought about more.
It might turn out after we think about it, we don't want to deal with it or it isn't needed.


Break down can be a little bigger than 5, but
40 is definitely too big.

I've had in the past 13-21. I like to use Fibonacci numbers when I can.
I think breakdown can be 13, accepted can be 21,

ready can be large as
it just indicates that the work has been refined enough to work on.

So we can refine many tasks, and they are just ready to pull in, they aren't prioritized, but
we've committed to working on them in the near future (we don't do sprints, we are pure kanban).

It's like the inbox, except we've validated the cards, pointed them etc. So
make the ready column like 55 for now. In progress can be 13. Review can be 8,
document can be 8. AI agents allow us to do many things in parallel. I can
usually run 5 reliably. If I improve my orchestration system... We'd like to
get the maximum number of concurrent tasks possible equal to the number of
packages we have, our current limitation is orchestration and organization so
we're focusing on getting this board working, and getting the MCP system
finalized. It mostly work. It works for  our custom build MCP endpoints, but
the stdio proxy system does not work.
