# new automated code review rule
A new kanban transition rule should be added to the review -> document transition that
runs an agent workflow with the task body and code chunks found to be relavent to
the task via nearest neighbor search + full mentioned files (or code blocks if line numbers are present on markdown link)

pending the completion of a task to trigger commits from kanban commands,
also the repo diff between the commit the task was marked in progress in,
to the current working tree state.
