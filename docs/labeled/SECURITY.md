# Security Policy

We take the security of the Promethean Framework seriously and appreciate coordinated disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email security reports to [security@promethean.ai](mailto:security@promethean.ai) or open a private advisory via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/riatzukiza/promethean/security/advisories/new).

Provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
- Any suggested mitigations

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and will work with you on remediation and coordinated disclosure timelines.

## Preferred Languages

Please submit reports in English.

## Policy

Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before we have confirmed and released a fix. We appreciate responsible testing and request that you avoid actions that could disrupt production systems or compromise data.
