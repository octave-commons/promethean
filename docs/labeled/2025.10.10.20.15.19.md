I think part of what we need is our own agent system, since I need features for my system that these existing tools do not expose. We have a package that wraps openai's agent sdk. There is the agent planner tool that just released. We have a lot of tools. We have the promethean CLI, I want to start actively using that to orchestrate every thing from the boards, to the mcp. That is the key to everything, it is self documenting, and natural language. if you say like went

```bash
promethean kanban get mcp tasks from icebox
```
or 
```bash
promethean "get mcp tasks from ice box and evaluate them, "
```

you turn the sub commands into sequences of ngrams with several different n values. you just get search terms from different combinations of the strings up to a limit n, so

using several different tools, vector database, grep, code symbol, you generate a list of related symbols for 

Then you score each of them for relavency with a small LLM

Then prompt an local small language model to generate a valid clojure expression given the list of related symbols, and the original sub command list

Some of those sub commands might spin up an agent that then work with the rest of the prompt as natural language.
