Context management is also an important feature of the enso protocol.
A users own contributions of a given conversation must be both visible, and controllable.
Users should be able to curate files/data sources for LLM usage, a data source can have several properties.
The specifics as to how the following are implemented can vary by implementation, but all must be present:

## Metadata

- owner(s): the user(s) or group(s) who owns a piece of data, and is allowed to decide it's availability to contexts
- source: Where is this data from? (fs, api, database, etc)
- location: How the data source is uniquely identified by a source.

## Discoverability

To a given context instance, a data source may be explicitly, or implicitly:

- invisible: The protocol is unaware of its existance
- discoverable: The protocol is able to discover this assets existance if there are links to it from a context session
- visible: The protocol is aware of it's existance
- hidden: Distinct from invisible, can only be found with a direct reference.

Explicitly a user can set these states ephemerally to a specific context for a data source. This is forgotten at the end of the context
Implicitly, a user can control discoverability by setting other properties or rules

## Context State

For a given context, a data source may be in one of the following states:
- active: Is currently a part of the context
- inactive: Is currently not a part of the context
- standby: Is discoverable from currently active context
- pinned: Explicitly added to the current context.
- ignored: Explicitly excluded from the current context

## Content management

From a given context, data source can be managed in some or all of the following ways:
- Readable: it's content can be a part of context
- Changable: It's content can be modified, but a record of all states is kept by the owner for a time, configurable by the user
- Movable: It can be renamed/moved
- Exchanged: Ownership transfered to another user (the original owner does not retain a copy)
- Sendable: A copy is given to another user (the original owner retains a copy)
- Addable: Added to the protocol for context management
- Removable: Removed from the protocol, no longer available to any context unless added
- deletable: Rarely, the protocol can delete a piece of date entirely, leaving no record of it's existance
- saveable: The current content saved to a file on the client's drive
- viewable: It's content made visible to users of the context other than the owner

## Availability
- private: Is only available in contexts exclusive to the owner (1 agent 1 user, many agents, 1 user)
- public: Is available in all contexts regardless of participants
- shared: Is available in contexts with explicitly set members
- conditional: Is available in contexts that match a sets of conditions.
  - Conditions may be "hard" (rules based) or "soft" (An LLM evaluates your condition).
  - Soft conditions always ask for approval,
  - hard conditions are met automatically
  - the requirement of approval is a possible condition
