# A new smart rule for incoming -> accepted
Add a new task to the board to implement a smart transition rule for
incoming -> accepted transition.

Incoming tasks are expected to be very loosely defined
they may not follow a format, it could just be a humans stream of consciousness

Run an agent workflow which scores the task body and file name
and globally related documents from the code base based on the following criteria:
- Coherence
- Feasability
- relavence
- value added
- urgency

Each score is on a scale of 1 to 10
if the average score is below 6, it is hard blocked
If the average score is below 8, it is soft blocked with a warning, and allowed to proceed the next time it is transitioned.

In all cases a rationale is provided for the overall score
and each sub score

The report is appended to the end of the task with a heading.
