# Makefile automation audit → pnpm workflow shift

## Summary
- Audited task backlog and board exports referencing `Makefile`/`Makefile.hy`.
- Confirmed no active automation depends on the legacy Makefile stack; pnpm + `scripts/dev.mjs` already cover dev workflows.
- Re-scoped backlog items to focus on pnpm workspace scripts and documentation instead of resurrecting Makefile targets.

## Impacted tasks
- `replace agent automation makefile targets with pnpm scripts`
- `audit makefile.hy remnants and confirm deprecation`
- `update github actions automation to pnpm scripts`
- `replace polyglot makefile with pnpm-first workflow docs`

## Follow-ups
- Update README/onboarding docs to describe pnpm-first workflows.
- Ensure CI pipelines adopt pnpm scripts before closing related tasks.
- Continue cataloging any lingering references to `Makefile.hy` during routine docs updates.
