I think tools is going to be one of those special folder names/words like dist/ src/ docs/, etc.
The robot understands "tools" it's trained on the idea of tools.
I'll use tools it knows about.
This means it'll use the tools advertised to it,
but also tools it finds.

When asked to create a tool, it will put it in the tools folder. It's a tool.
It's all just language
