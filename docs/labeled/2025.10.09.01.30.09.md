Alright, I used the endpoints:

### Kanban

* Moved your task **mcp-path-resolution-error** → **backlog** (breakdown and todo were blocked by WIP caps). You should see it there now.

### Tests (TDD)

* Tried to run `ava` on `packages/mcp/test/mcp-server.spec.ts` via the `tdd_run_tests` endpoint. It failed to boot the test runner on your side because the Fastify transport launched a bunch of endpoints and then hit a proxy error:

  * `Proxy response missing result field` while resolving `/proxy` actions in `fastify.ts:1035`.
  * Tons of “dev-ui assets not found… build @promethean/mcp-dev-ui” noise.
  * Multiple listeners spun up on random ports (normal for your transport), but the proxy didn’t return the expected MCP JSON-RPC envelope.

This indicates your TDD runner boots the MCP HTTP server in-process as part of the test harness. The proxy fixture (your “fake-proxy” stdio) is returning a body without a `result` field for `initialize`/`actions`, so the test harness blows up before AVA can even run the spec.

#### Quick fixes for the test runner:

1. In your proxy test fixture, ensure JSON-RPC responses include a `result` key for all successful calls (even if it’s `{}`).
2. Gate dev-ui logging in tests (`NODE_ENV=test` → suppress those asset warnings).
3. Optionally, run `pnpm --filter @promethean/mcp-dev-ui build` to generate assets if you actually want UI during tests (you probably don’t; better to stub).

If you want me to try different endpoints next: I can exercise the **PR review** tools (`github_pr_*`), **ETag**-aware `github_request` GETs, or **pnpm** helpers. Also happy to create more Kanban tasks and reshuffle columns within your WIP limits.
