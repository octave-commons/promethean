description: >-
  Promethean is a modular AI framework with specialized components for web
  crawling, search, multi-agent chat, and CLI interactions. It uses culturally
  inspired names for its tools: Tsukumo for web crawling, Kura for search
  providers, and Enso for multi-agent chat protocols. The framework supports
  structured data processing, caching, and cross-system search capabilities.
