# smart breakdown -> ready transition
Similar to other smart transitions, an agent workflow is ran on the breakdown -> ready transition.

The agent will be provided with the task + relavent content retrieved from the code base through a RAG pipeline

An agent will grade the task for clarity of intent, completeness, scope, alignment active work

As with the other transitions, if the over all score is  very low, it is hard blocked
if it is acceptable, but not ideal, it is soft blocked
