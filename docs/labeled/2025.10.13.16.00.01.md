# new smart transition rule for testing -> review
Write a new task for the board which:

Add a new rule which gathers test coverage reports for packages affected by the
changes made for this task.
Reject if they do not meet our standards (90% test coverage)

If test coverage is acceptable, run an agent workflow over the changed files focusing on the tests
specifically extract the description text of all tests related to the changed code

compare them each to the sub tasks, requirements, etc
include the best match for test -> requirement in the agent flow context
Also include the tests, and the affected chunks of code + nearest neighbor
matches between task requirements, tasks, dod, etc and code.

The agent work flow will provide an overall score between 0 and 100 for the whole task,
plus a score between 0 and 100 for each test, requirement, subtask, dod, etc plus rational for each.

This will be appended to the bottom of the task with a header `# Test Coverage Review <YYYY.DD.MM.hh.mm.ss>`
The overall score is added to the frontmatter.
the report includes rationale for the overall score
plus a breakdown of it's rational for each individual score.


if the average score is below 90% the task cannot transition.
In the rejection case, and provides actionable input,
and an action list that must be completed.
if the action item checklist has not been completed
as in:
```md
- [x] fix this problem
```
if the average score is below 75%, the task is blocked at first with a warning,
but allowed to go through the second time.

Instead of an action check list in the soft blocking case, a bullet list
of recomendations is provided
