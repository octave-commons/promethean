Here is a structured and categorized presentation of the tools available to me, organized by domain and
functionality:

## 🔧 Core Development & Code Manipulation Tools

### 📄 File Reading & Writing

• read: Reads a file from the filesystem with line-by-line output and numbering
• write: Writes content to a file, overwriting existing content
• edit: Performs string replacements in files with precise line-numbered context matching
• replaceAll: Replaces all occurrences of a string in a file (useful for renaming variables or functions)

### 🔍 Code Analysis & Search Tools

• grep: Searches file contents using regular expressions with pattern matching and file filtering
• glob: Finds files by pattern (e.g., **/*.ts, src/**/*.js) using glob patterns
• serena_find_symbol: Finds code symbols (classes, methods) by name path in a file
• serena_find_referencing_symbols: Finds references to a specific symbol across the codebase
• serena_read_file: Reads files with partial or full content retrieval based on line numbers
• serena_get_symbols_overview: Gets high-level overview of symbols in a file
• serena_search_for_pattern: Searches for patterns in non-code files or codebase with flexible matching

### 🔍 Web Content Retrieval Tools

• webfetch: Fetches content from a URL and returns it in text, markdown, or HTML format with optional prompting

---

## 🚀 Process Management & Automation Tools

### ⚪ Long-Running Process Tools

• process_start: Spawns a long-running background process (e.g., servers, watchers)
• process_status: Checks the status of a process by PID
• process_stop: Stops a running process by PID
• process_tail: Tails the stdout (ring buffer) of a process by PID
• process_list: Lists all active processes for safe viewing

### ⚪ PM2 (Node.js Process Manager) Tools

• pm2_getPM2Status: Gets PM2 daemon status and process overview
• pm2_listProcesses: Lists all PM2 processes with their status and information
• pm2_startProcess: Starts a process with PM2 using a configuration
• pm2_stopProcess: Stops a running PM2 process by name or ID
• pm2_restartProcess: Restarts a PM2 process by name or ID
• pm2_gracefulReload: Gracefully reloads a process (waits for connections to finish)
• pm2_scaleProcess: Scales a PM2 cluster to a specific number of instances
• pm2_showLogs: Displays logs for a PM2 process (stdout, stderr, or combined)
• pm2_monitor: Monitors PM2 processes in real-time
• pm2_flushLogs: Flushes logs for all or a specific process
• pm2_generateStartupScript: Generates startup script without executing it

## 🧠 AI & LLM Operations Tools

### ⚪ Ollama Queue Management

• ollama-queue_submitJob: Submits a new LLM job to the Ollama queue
• ollama-queue_getJobStatus: Gets the status of a specific Ollama job
• ollama-queue_getJobResult: Retrieves the result of a completed Ollama job
• ollama-queue_listJobs: Lists jobs with optional filtering by status or agent
• ollama-queue_getQueueInfo: Gets queue statistics and information
• ollama-queue_manageCache: Manages the prompt cache (clear, stats, performance analysis)
• ollama-queue_cancelJob: Cancels a pending Ollama job
• ollama-queue_submitFeedback: Submits feedback on a cached result to improve model routing

### ⚪ LLM Stack Optimization

• llm-stack-optimizer: Optimizes LLM performance (configuration, model selection, vLLM serving, DSL design)

• serena_switch_modes: Activates development modes like [editing, interactive] or [planning, one-shot]
• serena_think_about_collecteded_information: Evaluates if collected information is sufficient and relevant
• serena_think_about_task_adherence: Verifies whether current work aligns with task requirements
• serena_think_about_whether_you_are_done: Determines if work is complete
• serena_prepare_for_new_conversation: Preps for a new conversation (for resetting context)

---

## 📦 Repository & System Tools

• gh_grep_searchGitHub: Searches real-world GitHub code examples for actual implementation patterns
• context7_resolve_library_id: Resolves library names to Context7-compatible IDs
• context7_get_library_docs: Fetches updated documentation for libraries using Context7 IDs

This structured list provides a comprehensive view of the available tools, grouped by functionality to help you
quickly locate the right tool for your current task or workflow. Each tool has a specific purpose and can be used
in conjunction with others to solve complex problems efficiently.
