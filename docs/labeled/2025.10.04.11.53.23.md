One of the earliest notable predictions was by I.J. Good in 1965, who wrote about the likelihood of an "ultra-intelligent machine" being built within the 20th century. He introduced the concept of an "intelligence explosion," where such a machine could recursively improve itself, potentially surpassing human intelligence rapidly. This idea laid the philosophical groundwork for later concepts of AGI and superintelligence.
