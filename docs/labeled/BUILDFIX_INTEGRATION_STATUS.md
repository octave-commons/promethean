# BuildFix Integration Status

## ✅ Completed

1. **BuildFix Provider Implementation**: Successfully created `packages/benchmark/src/providers/buildfix.ts`

   - Implements BaseProvider interface
   - Handles BuildFix-specific benchmark execution
   - Supports both small and massive fixture sets
   - Proper error handling and result parsing

2. **Unified CLI Integration**:

   - Added BuildFix to provider types
   - Integrated into CLI health checks and provider listing
   - BuildFix provider shows as "Healthy" in health checks

3. **Type Safety**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved

## 🚧 Current Issues

1. **BuildFix Success Rate**: 0% success rate on both small and massive fixtures

   - Root cause: `ts-morph` import resolution failures in generated snippet files
   - Previous fixes attempted but not fully resolved

2. **Resource Issues**:

   - Ollama model runner crashes during execution
   - Memory issues (exit code 134 - OOM kills)
   - `__dirname` undefined in ESM modules

3. **Model Compatibility**:
   - BuildFix has its own model filtering logic
   - Only recognizes specific models: qwen3:8b, qwen3:14b, qwen2.5-coder:7b, promethean-planner, qwen3:4b, llama3:8b

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (Technical Debt)

1. Fix remaining BuildFix success rate issues
2. Resolve Ollama resource limitations
3. Fix `__dirname` undefined in ESM modules

### Integration

1. Add BuildFix-specific CLI options to unified benchmark CLI
2. Consolidate all BuildFix benchmark scripts into unified CLI
3. Add proper resource monitoring for BuildFix operations

### Long-term

1. Improve BuildFix success rate through better prompt engineering
2. Add support for more fixture types
3. Implement proper caching for BuildFix results

## 📊 Current Status

- **Integration**: ✅ Complete
- **Type Safety**: ✅ Complete
- **Health Checks**: ✅ Complete
- **Execution**: 🚧 Partial (runs but fails)
- **Success Rate**: ❌ 0% (needs fixing)

The unified benchmark CLI now supports BuildFix as a first-class provider alongside Ollama, VLLM, and OpenAI providers. While the integration is technically complete, the underlying BuildFix success rate issues need to be addressed for production use.
