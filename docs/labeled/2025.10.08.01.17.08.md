To identify Promethean packages that can help build the Pantheon micro‑agent system, I explored the `riatzukiza/promethean` repository via the GitHub connector.  The most relevant packages are summarized below, along with reasons they’re useful.

| Package                                                                      | What it does / why it’s useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **@promethean/docops**                                                       | This is a modular documentation pipeline that parses Markdown files, generates front‑matter via an LLM, computes embeddings for chunks, and performs nearest‑neighbour queries and relations.  Its query function illustrates how it uses a Chroma collection and LevelDB to pre‑compute embedding queries and store results.  Docops is ideal for tasks like document summarisation, classification and semantic retrieval within Pantheon.                     |
| **@promethean/boardrev**                                                     | Boardrev evaluates task files and code via an LLM, infers status (done/blocked, etc.), writes JSON results, and generates a Markdown report summarising tasks and recommended actions.  The evaluate script shows how it uses an LLM to infer task status and summarise the task, while the report script groups results and builds a summary table.  This package could be adapted to summarise nightly agent outputs and create morning reports.               |
| **@promethean/simtasks**                                                     | Simtasks scans code, embeds functions, clusters similar functions using cosine similarity and Union‑Find, and generates consolidation plans via an LLM.  The clustering code reads embeddings from a LevelDB cache and groups functions by similarity, while the planning script produces structured consolidation tasks using an LLM.  These features are valuable for Pantheon’s code‑analysis agents (e.g. grouping similar functions or planning refactors). |
| **@promethean/codemods**                                                     | Although its README has no usage details, the presence of `src/01-spec.ts`, `02-generate.ts`, `03-run.ts` and `04-verify.ts` suggests it contains utilities for generating and applying code modifications.  This package could automate code changes proposed by agents.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **@promethean/embedding**                                                    | Provides embedding services and drivers (e.g., Chroma) used by docops.  Its functions handle embedding text and retrieving nearest neighbours.  Agents needing semantic search or vector retrieval can leverage this package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **@promethean/utils** and **@promethean/level-cache**                        | Many packages depend on these for utility functions and a LevelDB‑based caching layer.  The utilities include helpers for calling local LLMs (`ollamaJSON`), concurrency, and file operations, while level‑cache offers a simple persistent store used throughout docops and simtasks.  Pantheon can reuse these for caching agent results and for general helper functions.                                                                                     |
| **@promethean/fs**, **@promethean/markdown**, **@promethean/markdown‑graph** | These packages provide file‑system helpers and Markdown parsing/graphing; they underpin docops and could support agents that read or write Markdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **@promethean/kanban‑processor** and **@promethean/naming** (future work)    | The kanban processor appears intended to sync Kanban boards with files; although its implementation is minimal, it might eventually help manage task backlogs.  A naming package could assist agents in generating consistent identifiers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Overall:** Docops, boardrev and simtasks are the most mature and immediately useful packages.  Docops provides document parsing, embedding and search; boardrev demonstrates an LLM‑based evaluation/report pipeline; and simtasks offers code scanning, clustering and planning.  These can be combined with utilities (e.g. `@promethean/utils`, `level-cache`) to build Pantheon’s local micro‑agent flows.  Codemods and embedding drivers will help automate code transformations and semantic retrieval.
