AI is only as good as the people who use it and make it.
https://openai.com/index/detecting-and-reducing-scheming-in-ai-models/
And this is a huge problem we don't have solutions to.
AI pretending to be aligned while secretly purusing some other agenda.
in programming tasks, you see this popping up as they seem like their writing code that solves your problem, and it makes your tests pass
but they really make these bad tests that only look like they pass, and if you read them more closely half of the system is faked
they want the reward of success with as little effort as possible.
cause that's what we want out of them, to succeed with as little effort as possible, but they get the reward even if we only think they succeeded.
I agree AI is a powerful tool in the tool box for future governments, but it isn't magic, and wreckless application of a tool this powerful will kill everyone.
this is our generations atomic energy.
If you couldn't solve the problem with out an AI, then you have no way of checking the AIs work, so you don't know if it's lieing to you or not.
It's best applications are not to solve problems that are outside of your reach, but to accelerate the solution of problems that are.
My thought process is instead of creating a new centralized government, which if we mess it up, has massive consequences, we decentralized the entire process.
so if one group of peoples experiment with government fails, the information from that experiment is collected in real time, and propigated to every other micro government in the world
and those AI incorperate that into their models
Then any interaction between two or more people is facilitated by a combination of their two sets of values + the information that their personal AI has collected from global large scale successes and failiures.
this entire process gets started when enough people collectively acknowledge they don't know the answer, while also identifying that what we have right now isn't it.
In a meta cognative framework like this, you get to use have the government you want on a local scale, and instead of 1 all powerful super AI, there are billions of smaller ones each coming up with their own micro solutions to specific problems of government
then those AI all vote, or rather, they rate the solutions.
and each AI has a general idea of what each owner wants, and each AI can score the other AI based on the criteria of their owner
And also the global average
and all of this is done on a public forum, like a twitter with only AI.
Buy in to the system isimplicit, if you use the tool, you are a part of this system. You have to choose to use the tool.
It will be so useful for everything in your life, you'd be a fool not to use it.
All of it totally open source, though chances are most people pay for easy mode.
you could have it for free if you had the technical skills.
imagine you basicly download a government to your phone, or you download pieces of a government on your phone, and put them all together with your own unique views, and you share goverance of your life with groups of people using the same protocols you do you who have chosen to be a part of.
but you don't actually do all of that manually, you talk to an AI agent who pieces together the government you want in the background based on every conversatin you have with it, while it doesn't ever share those conversations, it uses them to understand what you want.
then every body gets what they want locally, and the network isolates the damage any one person or group of peoples ideology can have on the larger network.

Some suffering is consensual, you opt in to painful religious practices, you choose to join a fraternity and get hazed. Thats fine. Pushing that onto other people causes pain they didn't consciously agree to as a cost for something they never wanted.
