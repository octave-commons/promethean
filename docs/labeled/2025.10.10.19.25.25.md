I need to organize my thoughts a bit. Our board is a little out of wack.
We need to do 2 things:

1. Adjust out WIP limits to better reflect our actual process
2. Deal with any continuing violations after our WIP limits are updated

I'm working with codex and several other agents on the board right now.
Codex is the best model but it has the greatest limits so we need to very carefully
Plan how we use it.

I asked codex to evaluate our board WIP limits:

## Codex generated board report

• Here’s the current WIP status compared to configured limits in
  promethean.kanban.json.

  Summary
  - accepted: 5/5 OK
  - breakdown: 40/5 VIOLATION +35
  - blocked: 3/3 OK
  - ready: 42/10 VIOLATION +32
  - todo: 53/20 VIOLATION +33
  - in_progress: 6/10 OK
  - testing: 0/8 OK
  - review: 2/6 OK
  - document: 4/4 OK
  - icebox: 77/9999 OK
  - incoming: 271/9999 OK
  - done: 0/500 OK
  - rejected: 20/20 OK

  Hotspots

  - breakdown over by 35
  - ready over by 32
  - todo over by 33

  Recommendations

  - Breakdown: Defer/merge duplicates to icebox or accepted; complete scoping for
    top priority tasks and advance only ≤5‐point slices to ready.
  - Ready: Pull highest priority items into todo; push under-specified items back
    to breakdown.
  - Todo: Enforce pull-based flow; either move non-started items back to ready or
    continue pulling into in_progress until near WIP.
