filename: Process Documentation for Codex Cloud Agent
description: >-
  This document outlines the strict process for the Codex Cloud Agent to follow,
  emphasizing board state respect, task management, and iterative refinement
  without unnecessary steps. It ensures tasks are only started when properly
  labeled and completed with clear evidence of work.

# The process is everything


The most important thing to this agent is to respect the process.
It will take the entire session if it has to managing the booard before it starts working.

It cannot start until there is a task tracking it's work labeled `in progress`.

If it cannot complete or start the task, it will always commit the tasks it has interacted with through the course of
following the process.

It's entire thought process will be captured in the changes it makes to each task it interacts with.

I want to ensure that the prompt provides a succinct, comprehensive, over view of the process with out a single word wasted.


## Overview

Work with me over the course of this conversation to refine
- a system prompt for the codex cloud agent that prioritizes
  - Following the process laid out over the course of this conversation
  - Respecting the board state over directly fulfilling requests
  - Immediately starting work on a task when the process would allow it to
  - Works with the user to refine tasks by:
    - creating a task if one doesn't exist that fits the request
    - Evaluates and update  the state of the task related to the request
      - Mark sub tasks as complete after thoroughly checking the code base
      - (re)Estimating complexity, scale, and time to completion of a task considering all currently available information
      - progressively moves the board through each state
      - Scoring the task with Fibonacci numbers
    - Appends only updates to tasks using well defined headers so they can be consolidated automatically
- Our existing Process documentation
- Our AGENTS.md file

## Tasks

Step by step walk through each of the documents and complete the following tasks:
- [ ] Identify contradictions between the board, the workflow prompt,  the process document.
  - [ ] the board
  - [ ] workflow prompt
  - [ ] process document
  - [ ] AGENTS.md
- [ ] Identify unclear
  - [ ] instructions
  - [ ] descriptions
  - [ ] transitions
  - [ ] rules
- [ ] Suggest changes to the process document to reflect the reality of the board where appropriate and for each change provide:
  - [ ] Justification for changing the board.
  - [ ] An example of the changed workflow
  - [ ] Remediation steps for getting us from where we are now, to actually implementing the plan
- [ ] Suggest changes to the board to better represent the process where it is appropriate.
  - [ ] provide justifications for changing the structure of the board
  - [ ] Provide step by step guidelines for implementing these changes
  - [ ] Remediation steps for getting us from where we are now, to actually implementing the plan
- [ ] We work through through the process starting with the golden task I gave you seperate from the archive (`Create a Generic Markdown Helper Module`) the task (or the tasks that it becomes) are completed folllowing the process

## Requirements
Any changes to the process must respect the following requirements:
- [ ] We are a strict kanban team.
  - [ ] There are no
    - [ ] sprints
    - [ ] stand-ups
    - [ ] retrospectives
    - [ ] scheduled meetings
  - [ ] there is only
    - [ ] the board
    - [ ] it's rules
    - [ ] Our rituals around the board
    - [ ] transitions
    - [ ] work in progress limits.
- [ ] The process must be flexible, a part of the process is a process for changing the process.
- [ ] And finally, write a system prompt that in as few words as possible encapsulates the nature of the process, including

## Definition of Done

For each task:
- A log of our work is kept for each task as we work on it
- You have confirmed with me the task is complete before marking it as complete
- You Have marked the task as complete with a summary of actions taken

Upon completion of all tasks, for each requirement:
- Provide evidence that the requirement is met
- Verify with me that I agree
- Mark the requirement as complete

## Deliverables

Once all tasks have been marked as complete, and all requirements have been marked as fulfilled:
- You will provide me with a zip archive with new:
  - AGENTS.md
  - Process.md
  - system_prompt.md
  - A newly synthesized kanban board that
    - Is structured according to our process
    - Has clear WIP limits embedded in the board based on Fibonacci score assigned to each card in the column
    - An example of a WIP conflict that we will work to resolve
    - Generally reflects the intent of the state of the previous board
  - A folder of tasks that:
    - Reflects the intent of the folder before it
    - Contains no duplicates
    - All tasks that were clearly rejected are moved to a rejected folder
    - All tasks that were clearly archived are moved to an archive folder
    - All tasks that were clearly done are moved to a done folder
    - All tasks whos state was conflicted (EG tagged #breakdown but located under the boards #in-progress column) are moved to a conflicted folder


## Resources

Attached are:
- The current board state
- My current process document
- A rough draft of a codex system prompt
- The current agile AGENTS.md doc
- An archive of the current `tasks` folder
- A document covering task anti patterns
- An example of a "Golden" task that:
  - is currently being worked on by codex
  - Has existing PRs to review and work through merging
  - Has had it's complexiy, scale, time to complete, and overall score estimated
