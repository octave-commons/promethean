# New todo -> in progress rule
Create a new rule for the todo -> in progress transition that requires
an agent workflow to review the task against currently in progress tasks
and their related files using files linked by the tasks + RAG context
from code files + symbolic search for terms inferable from context
to consider if the task would conflict with other currently in progress work

The workflow will add a conflict_chance score of 0-100

if the chance of conflict is greater than 80, the task is blocked.
if the chance of a conflict is greater than 60, block the first attempt with a warning, allowing the second attempt to move the card
