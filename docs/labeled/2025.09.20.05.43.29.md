  This document outlines a structured GitHub branching workflow with specific
  rules for development, documentation, and merging. It details how tasks flow
  from initial branches through testing and staging to the main branch, ensuring
  systematic and error-free code integration. The workflow includes both current
  implicit processes and a desired explicit flow for better control and
  migration.

# Github Branching Workflow

- **Branches:**
  - `chore/<task>`, `codex/<task>` go to `main`.

- **Development Setup:**
  - Use multiple computers (`stealth` and `yoga`) for development.
  - Changes flow from `dev/<hostname>` to `testing`, then `staging`, and finally
    `main`.

- **Typical Workflow:**
  1. `codex/<task>` -> `dev/codex-staging` -> `main`
  2. `feat/codex-<task>` indicates a human operator has taken over a Codex task.
  3. `<type>/<task>` branches for specific tasks.

- **Branching Rules:**
  - Prefixed with `codex/` indicate Codex responsibility.
  - Others are my responsibility unless default merging causes issues.

- **Obsidian Workflow:**
  1. `obsidian/<hostname>` -> `obsidian/staging` -> `obsidian/main` -> `docs/staging` -> `docs/staging`
  2. Ideal flow: `<describer>/<task>` -> `obsidian/testing` -> `dev/staging` ->
     `main`

- **Documentation Flow:**
  1. `<codex|docs|readme|etc>/<task>` -> `obsidian/<hostname>` ->
     `obsidian/staging` -> `main`
  2. Staging branch uses GitHub Actions for transformations.

## Diagrams

We have a kind of process at the moment.
We will capture the current flow we do implicitly
so we can begin to do it explicitly
And describe a step by step process that allows us to
migrate to an intentional flow with useful and well defined conditions
and a github workflow system taht works along side of it


```mermaid
graph TD;
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> feat/:taskname
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> dev/:hostname
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> main
    docTask[docs/:task] --> obsidian/:hostname
    obsidian/:hostname --> main
    feat/:taskname --> dev/:hostname

    feat/:taskname --> main
    dev/:hostname --> main

```

I don't have a lot of control over the codex branch names that I can figure out yet except through
the limited settings interface.
They get prefixed with `codex/` and the robot picks a `:task-name`
As a result, the codex branch flow in the diagram looks a bit chaotic,
because it is chaotic.

### Desired flow with well defined transitions
```mermaid

    subgraph WIP

      subgraph documentation
          DocsBranches["docs/:taskname"]
          LocalObsidianBranches["obsidian/:hostname"]
      end

      subgraph development
        FeatureBranches["feat/:taskname"]
        LocalDevBranches["dev/:hostname"]
        PackageDev["package/:name"]
      end
      Chore["chore/:taskname"]
    end


    subgraph validation
      DevTesting["dev/testing"]
      Staging["staging"]
    end

	FeatureBranches --> DevTesting
    LocalDevBranches --> DevTesting
    PackageDev --> DevTesting
    DevTesting --> Staging
    Staging --> main
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> FeatureBranches
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> DocsBranches
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> LocalObsidianBranches
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> LocalDevBranches
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> Chore
    codexTask[codex/:task-name] --> PackageDev

    LocalObsidianBranches --> DocsBranches
    Chore --> Staging

    DocsBranches --> Staging


```

This diagram shows how tasks progress from initial development to the `main`
branch, ensuring a structured and systematic approach.

## Merging Rules

### Feature -> `dev/testing` or `dev/<hostname>`

To merge into `dev/testing` or `dev/<hostname>`:
- PR must build and install without errors.
- Otherwise, it should be green.

### From `dev/testing` -> `dev/staging`

To merge into staging:
- No linting errors on the touched diffs.
- No failing tests along the changed paths.
- Only `dev/testing` and `dev/<hostname>` branches may merge into `dev/staging`.

### From `dev/staging` -> `main`

- Green from both directions:
  - `obsidian/staging` to `obsidian/main`
  - `main` to `obsidian/staging`

## Conclusion

By following these branching and merging rules, we ensure a systematic and
error-free workflow that maintains the integrity of our codebase. This structure
not only helps in managing changes efficiently but also ensures that any issues
are caught early on in the development process.

Feel free to adjust or refine these rules as needed based on feedback from team
members or additional use cases.
