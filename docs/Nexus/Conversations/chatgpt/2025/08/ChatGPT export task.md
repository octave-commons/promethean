> Write a task to make a chatgpt export data, maintaining an index of already processed messages and hashes. Since I have to grab the whole thing every time, we want to make sure we do not waste time on processing old content.

> Dropped a fresh task into a new canvas with a full DoD, data model, mermaid flow, and Sibilant-style pseudocode for the de-dup index + hashing ingest. Want me to tailor it to your Mongo/Chroma DualStore naming and wire a CLI skeleton next?
