> Yeah… this screams scam.
> 
> Quick read on the red flags from the screenshot:
> - They ask you to email a **Gmail** address (`…jobhelp@gmail.com`) instead of an official company domain. Big companies—especially defense—route you to a req ID on their careers site and use corporate email.
> - Posted **publicly under a random thread** instead of a DM/InMail.
> - **Title mismatch**: calls herself a “Director at Lockheed Martin” in the message, but the profile snippet says “Talent Acquisition Specialist.” 
> - **Vague role** (“unadvertised opening in our Supply Chain division”), not aligned with your background, and no **requisition number**.
> - **Urgency language** (“priority to early applicants,” “time-sensitive, high-impact”)—classic funnel copy.
> 
> What to do (fast + safe):
> 1. Don’t send anything to that Gmail. 
> 2. If you’re curious, reply (or DM) with something like:
>  > “Happy to chat. Please email me from your official Lockheed Martin address and share the requisition ID so I can apply via the careers portal. I don’t send resumes to personal emails.”
> 3. If they can’t provide a corporate email + req ID, block/report the account/comment.
> 4. Given your stated values (no military/defense), it’s also fine to just ignore and move on.
> 
> Want me to sanity-check the profile live and see if it’s legit? I can look it up and verify employment history, domain, and a real req number if it exists.

> Yeah, that profile + comment chain looks like a textbook fake-recruiter play.
> 
> Why I’m calling it a scam:
> - They told you to email a **Gmail** (`…jobhelp@gmail.com`). Legit Lockheed outreach will point you to the **official careers site** and come from a corporate domain (lockheedmartin.com or lmco.com), not personal email. Lockheed explicitly warns about this pattern. cite
> - It was posted **publicly** under a random thread instead of a DM/InMail with a requisition ID.
> - **Vague role** (“unadvertised opening in Supply Chain”) + **urgency** (“priority to early applicants”) are classic job-scam tells the FTC calls out. cite
> 
> What I’d do (copy/paste if you want to test them):
> > Thanks for reaching out. For security, I only proceed via official channels. Please email me from your **Lockheed corporate address** and share the **requisition ID** so I can apply on the **Lockheed careers site**. I don’t send resumes to personal email accounts.
> 
> If they can’t do that, block/report the account and move on. If you want, send me a couple screenshots of the profile header + “Experience” section and I’ll sanity-check further tells (account age, employment timeline, contact info).
> 
> Also—values check: you’ve said no defense work. Even if this were real, it’s outside your lane. So the easy choice is “nope.”

> OK... since I'm trying to brush up my security+ stuff... what would you classify this sort of attack as? The account was literally made this month....

> Short answer: **social engineering**.
> 
> If you want the Security+ vocabulary:
> 
> - **Phishing (social-media / “angler” phishing)** — using a public comment to hook targets and move them off-platform. 
> - **Impersonation + pretexting** — pretending to be a Lockheed director/recruiter with a plausible story (“unadvertised opening”). 
> - **Spear-phishing flavor** — personalized to you (replying to your comment), though likely sent to many. 
> - **Psychological triggers** — **authority** (“Director at Lockheed”), **urgency/scarcity** (“time-sensitive,” priority to early applicants). 
> - **Goal** — **PII/credential harvesting** (resume, contact info; later could pivot to advance-fee, malware résumé portal, or further targeted phish).
> 
> So for an exam box: **Social engineering → Phishing (social-media) with impersonation/pretexting, leveraging authority & urgency, aimed at PII harvesting.**
> 
> Since the account was created this month, treat it as **throwaway infrastructure**—another common IOC for this attack type.
