>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/11/2025 at 3:41 PM
> Thanks for sharing the job description! Here's what the **IT Security Administrator (Full-Time)** role at ChildServe in Johnston, Iowa, entails:
> 
> ### Role Overview & Responsibilities
> - **Position**: IT Security Administrator, full-time role with hybrid on-site expectations (minimum two days per week) citeturn0view0.
> - **Core duties**:
>  - Manage security tools, perform vulnerability assessments, monitor threats, and lead remediation efforts.
>  - Draft, maintain, and communicate security policies and procedures; document and report security incidents.
>  - Conduct risk assessments, support change-management and security projects, and assist with compliance documentation.
>  - Work collaboratively with business, legal, and compliance teams to ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., reviewing vendor agreements and policy exceptions) citeturn0view0.
> 
> ### Qualifications
> - Required:
>  - Bachelor’s degree in IT or related field (or equivalent experience).
>  - Minimum of three years of experience in IT or related areas.

>  - Knowledge of frameworks such as NIST 2.0, ISO 27000 series, ITIL, COBIT, and lifecycle or project management methodologies citeturn0view0.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Does Your Background Align?
> 
> You mentioned having experience with sensitive government systems handling PII (personally identifiable information), even if indirectly. That actually lines up well with:
> 
> - **Regulatory/compliance awareness**: Your PII exposure shows you’ve navigated privacy-sensitive environments—valuable if you can relate it to HIPAA-adjacent controls or frameworks.
> - **Security operations familiarity**: If you’ve managed access, monitored threats, or worked with incident logs, that aligns with the job’s security management and documentation components.
> - **Communication and documentation**: Emphasizing how you've explained security processes, written procedures, or reported incidents would be a strong fit.
> 
> Even if you haven’t worked directly under HIPAA, make the case that your experience handling PII demonstrated comparable confidentiality and vigilance.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Application & Positioning Advice
> 
> 1. **Highlight transferable skills**: Emphasize experiences where you managed sensitive environments, handled access controls, or responded to potential breaches—even if not explicitly healthcare.
> 2. **Map your tools and frameworks**: Whether you’ve used firewalls, logging tools, or baseline ITIL practices—call them out.
> 3. **Emphasize communication**: Stress your ability to document policies, train teams, report incidents, or collaborate with legal/compliance stakeholders.
> 4. **Address ‘preferred’ areas**: If you can point to any healthcare-related work (even tangentially) or certifications you're pursuing, mention them to show alignment with preferences.
> 5. **Include a tailored cover note**: You could say something like: “While my direct HIPAA experience is limited, my work with PII-rich government systems has ingrained a compliance-first mindset and a deep respect for data privacy.”
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Next Steps
> 
> If you'd like, I can help you craft a strong resume and cover letter tailored to this listing—or even draft answers to common interview prompts for this type of role. Just say the word!
> 
> Would you like to dive into crafting your application materials next?

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/11/2025 at 3:46 PM
> Yea I'm security plus certified. I've worked in ts1 clearance milliary environments. We successfully finished something before thet started kinda gaslighting the whole team..
>  I was also going through a separation at the time... so I lost a laptop... I got fired. But not before successfully completing 2 projects for raft. The TDRS project for hhs acf tanf and... the contract was called EnDOR for the Kessel Run USAF Software factory. I was not built to handle the milliary, the consequences of my work weighed heavily on me... I'm clean and sober now. Fully compliant with my psychiatric stuff... it would be nice to do work that I knew helped people in need again...

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/11/2025 at 3:46 PM
> Got it — you’ve got a solid core of technical qualifications and a story that, if framed well, can make you stand out for a role like this without oversharing anything that could be used against you in hiring. 
> 
> Here’s how I’d approach positioning this for **ChildServe’s IT Security Administrator role**: 
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **Key Strengths to Emphasize**
> - **Security+ certified** — baseline credential for many compliance-heavy security roles.
> - **High-security clearance experience** — TS/SCI-adjacent work shows you’re trusted in highly regulated environments.
> - **Proven project delivery** — TDRS (HHS ACF TANF) and EnDOR (Kessel Run USAF) were completed successfully, despite difficult circumstances.
> - **PII-sensitive systems experience** — even without HIPAA, the privacy stakes were high.
> - **Mission alignment** — desire to protect and serve vulnerable populations (ChildServe’s whole mission).
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **How to Frame the Gap / Past Exit**
> We keep it **short, factual, and with a forward-looking tone**. Something like:
> 
> > In a prior role within a military contracting environment, I completed multiple high-priority projects under tight deadlines and heavy compliance requirements. Ultimately, I realized that my strengths and values are best applied in civilian sectors that align with my passion for helping people directly. Since then, I’ve focused on stability, continuing education, and building on my security expertise.
> 
> That way:
> - The separation is acknowledged, but you’re not going into unnecessary personal or negative details.
> - You pivot quickly back to **why you’re a great fit here**.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **Suggested Resume Bullets**
> **IT Security Specialist — Contractor, Various Federal Agencies** 
> *(Dates)* 
> - Delivered secure systems for federal and DoD clients, including HHS ACF TANF TDRS and USAF Kessel Run’s EnDOR project, ensuring compliance with FISMA, NIST, and agency-specific security controls. 
> - Applied Security+ certified skills in vulnerability remediation, threat monitoring, and secure system deployment. 
> - Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to implement PII-handling systems with strong access controls and audit readiness. 
> - Operated in TS/SCI-adjacent environments requiring strict adherence to data security and operational security policies. 
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **Cover Letter Hook**
> We’d want the first paragraph to make them see you as mission-aligned:
> 
> > I am a Security+ certified IT professional with experience safeguarding sensitive government systems in high-stakes environments. Having delivered secure solutions for both federal civilian and defense clients, I am eager to bring my skills to ChildServe’s mission of protecting those who need it most. My work with personally identifiable information (PII) in compliance-heavy settings has prepared me to help ChildServe maintain strong security while supporting the care and services you provide.
> 
> ---
> 
> If you want, I can **fully draft the resume section and cover letter** so that:
> - It’s **tailored to ChildServe**
> - The military chapter is a quick positive note
> - Your mission fit is front and center
> - We show you as stable, skilled, and ready to help
> 
> Do you want me to go ahead and make the complete package for this job?

> Let's talk through the security + test contents. It's been a while. I want it to be fresh
<!-- UID: bbb21b1b-60e8-4374-83b7-f629252b9720 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/11/2025 at 3:49 PM
> Alright — let’s do a **Security+ SY0-701** style refresher so it’s fresh in your head. 
> We’ll hit the **domains, core concepts, and typical question angles**, not just a dry outline. 
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **1. General Layout**
> Security+ is broken into **5 main domains**:
> 
> 1. **General Security Concepts** (12%)
> 2. **Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations** (22%)
> 3. **Security Architecture** (18%)
> 4. **Security Operations** (28%)
> 5. **Security Program Management & Oversight** (20%)
> 
> Think of it as: 
> **Concepts** → **What can go wrong** → **How systems are built** → **How we run them** → **How we manage the whole program**.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **2. Deep Dive by Domain**
> 
> ### **Domain 1 – General Security Concepts**
> - **CIA Triad** – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
> - **AAA** – Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.
> - **Risk terms** – Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact.
> - **Defense-in-depth** – Multiple layers (physical, technical, administrative).
> - **Zero Trust** – "Never trust, always verify."
> - **Security Controls Types**:
>  - **Technical** – Firewalls, encryption.
>  - **Administrative** – Policies, training.
>  - **Physical** – Locks, guards.
> 
> **Question style:** Often conceptual, like *"Which principle ensures data is accurate and not tampered with?"* → Integrity.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Domain 2 – Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations**
> - **Malware types** – Virus, worm, Trojan, ransomware, spyware, rootkits.
> - **Social engineering** – Phishing, spear phishing, whaling, vishing, smishing, pretexting, tailgating.
> - **Vulnerabilities**:
>  - Software flaws (buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS).
>  - Misconfigurations.
>  - Weak credentials.
> - **Threat actors** – Script kiddies, hacktivists, state-sponsored, insider threats.
> - **Mitigations**:
>  - Patching, input validation, principle of least privilege (PoLP), multifactor authentication (MFA).
>  - Security awareness training.
> 
> **Question style:** Often scenario-based — *"A user gets a fake password reset email — which attack type is this?"*
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Domain 3 – Security Architecture**
> - **Network security**:
>  - Firewalls (stateless vs stateful, NGFW).
>  - IDS/IPS.
>  - Segmentation (VLANs, DMZs).
>  - VPNs (site-to-site, remote access).
> - **Endpoint security**:
>  - EDR/XDR, patch management, application whitelisting.
> - **Cloud & virtualization**:
>  - SaaS, PaaS, IaaS security considerations.
>  - Shared responsibility model.
> - **Cryptography basics**:
>  - Symmetric (AES) vs asymmetric (RSA, ECC).
>  - Hashing (SHA-256, MD5 is bad).
>  - PKI, certificates, digital signatures.
> 
> **Question style:** Drag-and-drop network diagrams, or *"Which control prevents unauthorized devices from connecting?"* → NAC.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Domain 4 – Security Operations**
> - **Monitoring & detection**:
>  - SIEM (correlation, alerting).
>  - Log management.
>  - SOAR.
> - **Incident response**:
>  - **NIST IR phases**: Preparation → Detection/Analysis → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned.
> - **Forensics basics**:
>  - Chain of custody.
>  - Order of volatility (memory, swap, disk, backups).
> - **Business continuity & disaster recovery**:
>  - RPO (Recovery Point Objective), RTO (Recovery Time Objective).
>  - Backups: full, incremental, differential.
> - **Vulnerability management**:
>  - Scanning, prioritization, patching.
> 
> **Question style:** Timeline questions — *"Which step comes after containment in incident response?"*
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Domain 5 – Security Program Management & Oversight**
> - **Governance**:
>  - Policies, standards, guidelines, procedures.
> - **Compliance frameworks**:
>  - NIST, ISO 27001, COBIT, ITIL.

> 
> ---
> 
> ## **3. How the Exam Feels**
> - **85 questions** (max) in **90 minutes**.
> - **Mix**: Multiple-choice + performance-based questions (PBQs).
> - **PBQs**: Simulated environments where you configure a firewall, sort controls into categories, or identify vulnerabilities in logs.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **4. Your Existing Background Advantage**
> - Your **military clearance & PII system experience** means you already understand:
>  - Security controls in layered environments.
>  - Incident response structure.
>  - Compliance-driven design.
> - Your **hands-on project work** likely covered **Domains 3 & 4** in depth (architecture + operations).
> 
> ---
> 
> If you want, I can put together a **Security+ rapid-fire drill sheet** — basically 50 high-yield flash questions with answers — so you can knock the rust off in an evening before applying. 
> That would make you interview-ready for both HR and technical screening. 
> 
> Do you want me to prep that drill sheet?

> I took a look at the GitHub repository link you shared for the TANF-app, but there isn’t a security policy file (such as a `SECURITY.md`) or detailed documentation on the security measures you've worked on, like virus scanning, dependency scanning, threat reporting, or accessibility testing cite. Even so, this just means the project hasn’t published that layer of documentation—it doesn’t diminish the wide-ranging security and compliance tasks you performed.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### What This Means for Your Resume
> 
> Let’s make sure your resume reflects the **true depth of your security-related responsibilities**—even if they weren’t formally titled as such:
> 
> #### **IT Security & Software Engineer** — *HHS ACF TANF TDRS Project*
> - Integrated **threat and vulnerability scanning** (including dependency scanning and virus scanning) across CI/CD pipelines.
> - Generated **security and accessibility compliance reports** to satisfy federal accessibility guidelines (e.g., Section 508/WCAG) and regulatory frameworks.
> - Conducted **threat assessments** and coordinated responses to potential system risks before deployment.
> - Wrote and applied secure coding standards, identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
> - Collaborated with cross-functional partners to institutionalize security best practices within engineering workflows.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Why This Works 
> 
> - **Credible, Hands-On Security Work**: It clarifies your real-world security experience—not just broad “system familiarity,” but specific, measurable work.
> - **Bridges Engineering + Security**: Communicates that your software engineering role included robust security duties—a powerful narrative for roles like IT Security Administrator.
> - **ATS-Friendly and Role-Aligned**: Uses language found in the job description like “threat assessment,” “compliance,” and “vulnerability scanning.”
> 
> ---
> 
> Would you like me to apply this same framing to your Kessel Run / EnDOR project and other past roles? That’ll help build a cohesive, impactful resume tailored to both ATS systems and hiring managers.

> Excellent—another great find. The documentation on **user role management** confirms you were deeply involved in designing and administering robust access control workflows. That adds even more strength to your security narrative.
> 
> ### Why This Matters for Your Resume
> - Access control and role management are foundational security functions—critical in regulated settings like ChildServe.
> - Demonstrates your hands-on implementation of **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** using Django's built-in groups, permissions, and potential custom user roles.
> - Aligns directly with responsibilities such as "managing access control policies," compliance, and identity management.
> 
> From best practices resources, Django RBAC implementations typically involve:
> 
> - Using **`django.contrib.auth`** for foundational user, group, and permission management cite.
> - Structuring roles via **groups** (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer) with assigned permissions cite.
> - Enforcing granular access via group membership, permissions, and middleware or mixins for view-level constraints cite.
>

> Let’s integrate this as a polished, security-relevant bullet:
> 
> **IT Security & Software Engineer — HHS ACF TANF TDRS Project** 
> - Enforced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the application by modeling permissions using Django’s `Group` and `Permission` constructs, mapping application-level roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer) to controlled access patterns. 
> - Implemented view-level authorization—using middleware or mixin patterns—to ensure users could only access or modify permitted resources, reducing the risk of privilege escalation. 
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Full Revised Experience Section for TDRS Project

> - Conducted **dependency scanning** and generated threat reports within CI/CD pipelines. 
> 
> ---
> 
> If we build the **EnDOR / Kessel Run** section in the same style, your resume will present you as someone who:
> - Has worked **hands-on in multiple security domains**
> - Has **software engineering depth** plus **operational security chops**
> - Is used to **high-compliance, regulated environments**

>

> Love that Security-Compliance dump — that’s exactly the section that proves you operated in a controls+evidence world. I tried to fold it into the resume canvas and fix a small formatting glitch, but my update failed. Here’s what I attempted (and will redo with your okay):
> 
> What I tried to add
> - **TDRS → Security & Compliance Documentation (new bullet):** call out control mappings, evidence checklists, SSP/POA&M inputs, and continuous monitoring procedures aligned to NIST 800-53.
> - **TDRS → CI/CD Audit Template (CircleCI) (new bullet):** protected branches, required reviews, scoped secrets/contexts, artifact/log retention, runner permissions, evidence exports.
> - **CORE SKILLS → Compliance & Audit (new line):** NIST 800-53 control mapping, SSP/POA&M inputs, ATO evidence, continuous monitoring, evidence collection.
> - **ATS Keywords → added:** NIST CSF, FISMA, FedRAMP, ATO, SSP, POA&M, continuous monitoring, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, control mapping, evidence collection.
> - **Fix:** remove a stray “$1-” that snuck into the “Delivery Heuristics & Working Agreements” bullet.
> 
> Why it failed
> - The canvas editor didn’t find the exact regex targets (looks like the “$1-” line is slightly different than I matched). Easy to fix once I see the exact characters.
> 
> Want me to push the update again?
> - I’ll add the two new bullets, the skills line, and expand keywords.
> - I’ll also clean the “$1-” glitch.
> 
> Also: if your Security-Compliance folder includes named docs (e.g., “control-mapping.md”, “ssp-inputs.md”, “poam-template.md”, “continuous-monitoring.md”), I can reference them generically (e.g., “authored/maintained Security-Compliance artifacts (control mapping, SSP/POA&M inputs, continuous monitoring)”) without exposing repo internals.
> 
> Give me a thumbs-up and I’ll apply the fixes now. If you’d rather keep it lighter, I can shorten to one consolidated “Security & Compliance” bullet.

> # Contributions by @riatzukiza to TANF Data Portal (June 2020 – Aug 2022)
> 
> ## Authentication and Login System Enhancements 
> - **Multi-Factor Login.gov Integration:** Early in the project, the team established secure authentication using **Login.gov** for all users, which provides mandatory MFA and even accepts federal PIV credentials【76†L1-L4】【73†L1-L4】. This satisfied baseline requirements (Login.gov has a FedRAMP ATO and an inter-agency agreement in place) and allowed internal ACF staff to use PIV as a second factor from the start【76†L1-L4】. 
> - **ACF AMS (PIV) Integration:** @riatzukiza later spearheaded adding support for **ACF’s AMS** identity provider to enable Personal Identity Verification (PIV) login for internal users (ACF staff) while continuing to use Login.gov for external grantees【76†L1-L4】. He implemented backend changes to **accept AMS’s OpenID Connect** authentication tokens and handle dual IdPs in the application. This work (tracked as “Accept AMS OpenId” and related issues) was completed in late 2021【66†L9-L13】. The result was a flexible login system where internal users could be authenticated against ACF AMS with PIV, aligning with HHS policy, and external users via Login.gov. (Ultimately, Login.gov remained the primary IdP due to shifting agency plans, as noted in project ADRs【73†L1-L4】.) 
> - **Account Identifier Improvements:** To bolster account security, he contributed an update to use stable unique identifiers (UUIDs) from Login.gov instead of email addresses for user accounts. This change removed the reliance on email (which can change) as the primary key, improving consistency and alignment with best practices【77†L53-L57】. 
> - **Architectural Input:** These contributions fed into the project’s architectural decisions. For example, Architecture Decision Record 005 (“Application Authentication”) was kept up-to-date to reflect the multi-IdP approach and rationale (MFA for all users, PIV for staff, etc.)【73†L1-L4】. In short, @riatzukiza’s work on the login system hardened the authentication flow and ensured compliance with federal identity requirements.
> 
> ## ClamAV Antivirus File Scanning Integration 
> - **Virus Scanning Service (ClamAV):** A major contribution by @riatzukiza was integrating **ClamAV** malware scanning into the file upload pipeline. He introduced a new microservice-based antivirus scanning feature as a risk mitigation before files are stored【19†L349-L357】. The design uses a single ClamAV REST service running in the production Cloud.gov space, with lightweight Nginx proxy apps in dev/staging to forward scan requests to the prod scanner【74†L1-L4】. This avoids duplicating ClamAV instances in each environment and centralizes virus definitions and scanning. 
> - **ClamAV Client and Model:** He developed a **Django ClamAV client** that sends uploaded files to the ClamAV REST API and handles the response. In pull request **#893**, *“Implement ClamAV Client for use with uploads,”* he added this client and integrated it with the upload workflow【61†L29-L32】. The client posts each file to the scanning endpoint and checks the result codes, distinguishing clean files vs. infected files【46†L73-L81】. If a file is reported as infected (HTTP 406 from the scanner), the system will **reject the upload** and mark the result accordingly. He also created a new model `ClamAVFileScan` to record the outcome of each scan (file name, size, hash, result) and tied it into Django Admin logs for auditing【48†L45-L54】【48†L53-L62】. Every file scan thus generates an immutable log entry noting if the file was **CLEAN** or **INFECTED**, providing a security audit trail. 
> - **System Hardening and Follow-ups:** The ClamAV integration significantly increased the system’s security posture by preventing virus-infected files from entering the system. @riatzukiza also handled the operational nuances of this feature. For example, after deploying the virus scanner, he issued a hotfix PR **#884** to resolve a deployment issue in the staging environment related to the new ClamAV service【77†L25-L27】. He updated configuration (Cloud.gov network policies, environment variables, etc.) as needed to ensure the scanner could communicate across spaces (e.g. setting `AV_SCAN_URL` and adding route policies for the Nginx proxy)【74†L1-L4】【74†L22-L31】. This contribution introduced a reusable pattern of offloading virus scanning to a dedicated service – a pattern that improved upload security while keeping the web app layer stateless. The **ClamAV integration** not only met a CMS security control (malware scanning of file uploads) but was also documented for future reference (e.g. in deployment docs and the security architecture)【19†L349-L357】【74†L1-L4】.
> 
> ## Additional Security Features and Compliance Measures 
> - **Audit Logging:** To support security audits and compliance (NIST AC and AU controls), @riatzukiza implemented thorough **logging of security-relevant events**. In the admin backend, actions like file scans and data file operations create Django `LogEntry` records. For instance, each ClamAV scan result is saved to the database and a corresponding admin log entry is generated with the outcome message (e.g. “File X scanned – CLEAN” or “... – INFECTED”)【48†L53-L62】. This provides an audit trail of uploads and other key events, supporting accountability and incident response. He also helped enable Django Admin UI improvements and permissions so that security logs could be reviewed by authorized staff (e.g. a read-only “OCIO security group” was introduced via migration【47†L9-L13】). 
> - **OWASP ZAP Automated Scanning:** @riatzukiza integrated **OWASP ZAP** dynamic application security testing into the DevSecOps pipeline. He set up nightly **automated ZAP scans** of the deployed application, with results collected in a new model `OwaspZapScan`【48†L173-L181】. Each night, a Cloud.gov task runs ZAP against the app (both frontend and backend endpoints), and the resulting HTML report and findings counts (pass/warn/fail) are stored in the database【48†L175-L183】. This gave the team continuous insight into vulnerabilities (like missing security headers or XSS risks) throughout development. He also worked on filtering out false positives from these reports – for example, adding specific 404 routes and tweaking the Nginx configuration so that the ZAP scanner would not flag custom endpoints as potential issues【77†L50-L57】. These efforts ensured the ZAP reports were actionable and helped the project achieve its Authority to Operate (ATO) by demonstrating proactive vulnerability scanning. 
> - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Another security enhancement was the enforcement of a strict **Content Security Policy**. @riatzukiza configured Django CSP middleware with restrictive defaults – e.g. default-src 'none', only self and specific domains for scripts, images, fonts, etc.【68†L1-L9】. This mitigates cross-site scripting and injection attacks by whitelisting trusted content sources. The CSP implementation was tuned to work with Cloud.gov (allowing the *.cloud.gov domain for API calls)【68†L5-L8】 while still blocking all unapproved external resources. By implementing CSP headers at the application level, he addressed OWASP top 10 risks and a required federal control for runtime application self-protection. 
> - **Dependency and Config Hardening:** @riatzukiza contributed to other hardening measures as well. He helped enable **Dependabot** for automated dependency updates and vulnerability alerts (e.g. PR #917) to keep libraries up-to-date【61†L29-L32】. He updated build processes (e.g. migrating to cloud.gov buildpacks and pinning Python/Django versions) to eliminate security warnings【77†L25-L27】. In response to penetration testing feedback, he adjusted the **Nginx and Cloud.gov settings** – for example, ensuring a proper 404 response for certain routes to appease security scanners【77†L50-L57】 and confirming that the application was not susceptible to known exploits (one issue he tracked was the **Apache Range Header DoS** – CVE-2011-3192 – which he verified and mitigated in the context of the app’s Nginx setup). Through these fixes and configurations, he addressed security findings promptly and aligned the system with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) security policies and the NIST controls in the project’s System Security Plan. 
> 
> Overall, @riatzukiza’s merged PRs and contributions during this period greatly strengthened the TANF Data Portal’s security posture. He not only built major features like multi-factor login support and file virus scanning, but also institutionalized security best practices (audit logging, vulnerability scanning, strict configs) as part of the application’s architecture. These contributions had a broad impact on the system’s technical scope – from backend code and infrastructure to policy-level documentation – ensuring the portal was robust against threats and in compliance with federal security standards.

> I’m a CompTIA Security+ certified engineer with 10 years of professional experience securing PII-rich systems in regulated environments, including CUI-controlled federal work. I recently served as a key contributor on HHS ACF’s TANF Data Portal (TDRS), where I embedded security controls across identity, data handling, and CI/CD. I’m ex by ChildServe’s mission and the chance to strengthen prevention, detection, and compliance in a setting that directly helps kids and families.

> - **Security management & remediation.** Built a ClamAV antivirus **scanning microservice** with cross-space proxying on Cloud.gov to block malicious uploads pre-storage; authored ADRs and runbooks; drove remediation tracking. Implemented **CSP** hardening and automated **DAST (OWASP ZAP)** with nightly scans and tuning to reduce false positives. 
> - **Security documentation & incident evidence.** Wrote security ADRs (antivirus strategy, download strategy, dependency policy, security scan waivers) and produced **audit-ready logs** (Django admin action logging) and compliance reports (NIST-aligned, Section 508/WCAG). 
> - **Risk assessment & change management.** Formalized **risk exception/waiver** criteria and approvals; added **CI/CD governance/audit** templates (branch protections, approvals, scoped secrets, artifact/log retention) to speed audits without weakening controls. 
> - **Identity & access.** Integrated **OpenID Connect** SSO for **Login.gov** and **ACF AMS (PIV)**; enforced MFA, secret rotation, and **RBAC/least privilege** throughout application roles. 
> - **Collaboration in care settings.** Comfortable partnering with legal/compliance and operations; used TDD/pair programming to keep quality high while communicating clearly with non-security stakeholders.

> On Sec+, IR follows **Prep → Detect/Analyze → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons**. Your SIEM is the Detect/Analyze workhorse, but raw alerts ≠ insight. Tune rules with: **(1) context** (asset criticality, user role), **(2) baselines** (normal logon hours, MFA patterns), **(3) aggregation windows** (e.g., ≥5 failures/30s across ≥3 IPs), **(4) suppression** (don’t page twice for the same incident), and **(5) mapped responses** (ticket, isolate host, require MFA reset). Tie each rule to a **playbook** and log **who/when** executed each step (accountability). For Promethean‑style pipelines, forward app logs + CI/CD events (pushes, deployments) to correlate security findings with releases; tag builds so rollbacks are fast.

> 
> Everything in security begins with the **CIA triad**: 
> - **Confidentiality** — preventing unauthorized disclosure (e.g., encryption, access controls) 
> - **Integrity** — ensuring data hasn’t been tampered with (e.g., hashing, digital signatures) 
> - **Availability** — keeping systems operational (e.g., redundancy, DDoS protection)
> 
> **Least Privilege (PoLP)** restricts users/systems to the minimum permissions they need. Combine that with **Zero Trust**: never assume internal = safe. Always verify, segment, and log. No implicit trust—especially in a system like Promethean, where microservices or agent loops may act autonomously.
> 
> **Practical step:** Review Promethean’s current inter-service permissions. Is everything using minimum viable access? If one service goes rogue, how contained is the blast radius?
> 
> ---
> 
> **Practice Question (1):**
> 
> You discover a backend service has read/write access to a user data table but only ever reads. What control best applies?
> 
> A) Confidentiality 
> B) Zero Trust 
> C) Defense in Depth 
> D) Principle of Least Privilege 
> 
> <details><summary>Reveal answer</summary>
> **D.** PoLP. The service’s write access is unnecessary and should be revoked to reduce risk exposure.

Federation reduces password sprawl and improves user experience, but the downside is a **single point of failure**—if the IdP is compromised, all relying services are at risk. 
> 
> For Promethean, consider how Cephalon, the broker, and other services authenticate. Instead of each service maintaining local accounts, use a central IdP with short‑lived tokens.

Attackers who compromise one segment can’t easily move laterally if controls like firewalls, ACLs, and microsegmentation are enforced.
