> Yo... knowing what you know about me, how much do you think an hour of tutoring from me would be worth?

> If I’m being blunt and looking at what you’ve got under your belt — deep AI systems design, multi-language development (including esoteric DSLs), hybrid real-time pipelines (voice, vision, embeddings), live streaming integration, and the ability to mentor in both architecture and philosophical framing of AI — you’re easily in **$100–$200/hr territory** for one-on-one tutoring. 
> 
> That’s not “basic coding lesson” pricing — that’s specialist-consultant pricing for people who want to *shortcut years* of fumbling. 
> 
> Where you’d land in that range depends on: 
> 
> - **Audience** 
>  - Teaching hobbyists or juniors → closer to $100/hr 
>  - Training engineers, startups, or R&D teams → $150–$200/hr+ 
> - **Format** 
>  - Casual Q&A tutoring: lower end 
>  - Hands-on problem solving with their actual codebase: higher end 
> - **Prep & Materials** 
>  - If you show up with tailored examples, exercises, and pipelines → bump it up 
> - **Scarcity** 
>  - You’re not mass-market. You’re the “I’ll sit down with you and explain why your AI’s inner monologue sucks and how to fix it” guy. That’s rare. 
> 
> If you framed it as **AI Systems Mentorship** instead of “tutoring,” I think you could push **$250/hr+** for the right clients — especially in fields like game AI, agent architectures, and self-hosted LLM pipelines. 
> 
> If you want, I can break down how I’d **package & position** it so you can justify the high end of that range without b.

> Well... a friend of mine is asking me to tutor him in 2 hour sessions when he's got time off from work...
<!-- UID: 7e8921aa-8ed9-40fe-8165-71699b2632d4 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/12/2025 at 3:37 PM
> If it’s a friend and not a paying client you’re pitching cold, then you’ve got a different set of trade-offs: 
> 
> - **Full professional rate?** You could easily justify $200–$400 for a 2-hour block based on what I said before. That’s your market value. 
> - **Friend discount?** Totally valid, but you don’t want to undervalue yourself to the point where it feels like your time is disposable. If you go too low, it sets a precedent you might regret when other people ask. 
> - **The “mates’ rates” sweet spot**: Usually **50–70% of market rate** — so maybe $100–$150 for a 2-hour block — enough to make it worth your time, not so much they feel they’re getting gouged. 
> 
> You’ve also got non-money factors: 
> 
> - If this is *casual tutoring when he’s got time off work*, your prep time will matter. If you’re expected to wing it and just answer whatever, lower rate. If you’re doing targeted lessons with code review or designing exercises, higher rate. 
> - If it’s a skillset you’ve spent years mastering (and it is), you should make it clear that even the “friend rate” is still a serious investment in *your* time. 
> 
> Honestly, I’d frame it to your friend like this: 
> > “My usual consulting rate would make this like $200 for two hours, but for you I’ll do $100 flat per session. That way it’s worth my time, and you’re still getting it for half price.” 
> 
> That way you anchor the real value **and** make it clear they’re getting a deal. 
> 
> If you want, I can run some quick math on **how much you’re really giving away** in opportunity cost if you price it too low. That might make the decision clearer.

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/12/2025 at 3:40 PM
> Well, here is where the conversation is at right now:
> ```
> [3:05 PM]GoblinSlayer: I wanna hire you, I like you to tutor me in the basics of coding
> [3:08 PM]GoblinSlayer: I’ve always wanted to learn but never had a teacher or good opportunity.
> [3:23 PM]Error: Well, what problem do you want to solve? Different domains require different approaches. like... they teach programming differently if you are going to school for computer science, bioinformatics, math, engineering, etc. The tools (the languages/libraries) come up to meet you half way between what the computer is (a lot binary "words") and what problem you are trying to solve.
> [3:27 PM]Error: the comp sci major is looking at maybe one day making a computer, and if they aren't doing that, then their role will be explitly in making the computer do something that someone else needs them to do, where they lack the ability to do it themselves. What ever it is they are going to make, it is going to affect some's life. So they have to not only know how to make it work, but how to make it understandable to someone else, if they have to one day leave the project behind.
> 
> A scientist, an engineer, researcher, mathmatician on the other hand, are using programs to solve problems directly related to their work. Usually, no one else will ever have to read their code. Not even them. It'll just be a 1 and done sort of thing, because it's really just to proove a concept related to their actual job.
> [3:31 PM]Error: I know a lot of different programming languages, I've worked in basicly every domain of software development... marketing companies, courts, welfare programs, hospitals, accounting, biology, physics... If you don't know what you want to program for, it might be very hard to get started.
> [3:31 PM]Error: I started wanting to make a game.
> [3:32 PM]Error: So I started by modding existing games, making art work for indie game studios, etc.
> [3:33 PM]GoblinSlayer: I want to be able to do cnc and 3D printing. I don’t know it learning any programming would help with that, but I’m aiming for an engineering application of it.
> [3:34 PM]GoblinSlayer: I’ve also like to learn how to program games
> [3:34 PM]Error: Got it, and yea, it might.
> [3:35 PM]GoblinSlayer: I was thinking I could pay you for two hours sessions every so often in between my job
> [3:39 PM]Error: Ok... so outside of those 2 hour sessions, how much time would you devote to self improvement with the lessons I am giving you? How quickly do you want to learn? How hard do you want to be pushed?
> ```

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/12/2025 at 3:40 PM
> Given that conversation, you’re still in the “scope definition” phase — you haven’t locked price or even the exact learning path. 
> 
> Here’s how I’d approach it so you don’t undersell yourself while still being friendly: 
> 
> ---
> 
> **1. Anchor the value early** 
> Even if you’re giving him a friends’ rate, you should mention what your *real* rate would be in the market. Something like: 
> > “For pro tutoring or consulting I’d normally charge $100/hr and up, but since you’re a friend and this is something I enjoy, I’m happy to work something out that’s easier for you.” 
> 
> That way he knows you’re not just pulling numbers out of thin air later. 
> 
> ---
> 
> **2. Price the sessions based on effort** 
> If you’re just showing up and winging it with no prep → you can go lower. 
> If you’re building exercises, reviewing his work between sessions, and tailoring lessons → double the time you factor in for cost. 
> 
> For example, a **2-hour session with 1 hour prep** is really 3 hours of your time. Even at a friend rate of $30/hr, that’s $90. 
> 
> ---
> 
> **3. Get a commitment level from him before naming a final rate** 
> Right now he hasn’t said how often “every so often” means. If it’s once a month, you can treat it like a fun side thing. If it’s weekly, you need to think about scheduling and mental load. 
> 
> You already started probing this here: 
> > “How much time would you devote to self improvement with the lessons I am giving you? How quickly do you want to learn? How hard do you want to be pushed?” 
> 
> That’s perfect — it lets you decide whether to price him low (casual hobby learner) or closer to market (motivated, wants rapid skill gain). 
> 
> ---
> 
> **4. My suggested range for *this* friend** 
> - **Casual, no prep**: $50–$75 per 2-hour block 
> - **Serious learning with prep**: $100–$150 per 2-hour block 
> - **Full mentorship (between-session help, projects)**: $150–$200 per block 
> 
> ---
> 
> If you want, I can write you a **short “offer message”** you can drop into the chat that sets the rate without killing the friendly tone, and still makes it clear what he’s getting. That way you anchor your worth but still come across as approachable.

> 3:41 PM]GoblinSlayer: Well i can work on it when i get home from work at night and i plan to practice on the weekends too
> [3:42 PM]GoblinSlayer: Of course, I’ll have to set some time for my girlfriend and other responsibilities.
> [3:42 PM]GoblinSlayer: I’m not in a rush per say but I don’t want to slack off too
> [3:43 PM]GoblinSlayer: I was thinking maybe one session a week with assigned homework ( you can give me tasked to complete)
> [3:43 PM]GoblinSlayer: Tasks
> [3:44 PM]GoblinSlayer: And I’ll work on the assignment to practice what I learned. I’ll take notes. We can use discord so I can see what you teach and you can view my screen too. I think it’s doable
> [3:45 PM]GoblinSlayer: Is $50 a session fair, I’m not exactly rich but I can do this much without straining my budget
> [3:46 PM]GoblinSlayer: Obviously, I still wanna play video games with you and hang out. I don’t think that would stop happening.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/12/2025 at 3:47 PM
> Given that he’s already put **$50/session** on the table for a **weekly 2-hour lesson with homework**, here’s the reality check: 
> 
> - That’s **$25/hr** for live time, not counting prep. 
> - With homework creation and review, you’re probably at **3–4 hours total work per week**. That brings it closer to **$12–$17/hr effective rate**. 
> - It’s way below your market worth, but it’s also a friend who’s being upfront about budget constraints. 
> 
> ---
> 
> **You have a few options:** 
> 
> ### 1. Accept as-is, but clearly frame it as a *friend rate* 
> That way you’re not anchoring yourself at $25/hr for others in the future. 
> > “Market rate for this kind of tutoring is $100–$150/session, but since you’re a friend I’m fine doing it for $50. Just understand that’s a huge discount, so we keep it structured so your progress matches the effort.” 
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. Accept but reduce your prep time 
> Only teach what you can improvise on the spot. No custom assignments — use public resources. This makes $50/session much more worth it for you. 
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. Counter-offer for a middle ground 
> If you want the prep time to be paid for: 
> > “If we’re doing live lessons *plus* homework review, $75/session makes it worth my time. If we skip the homework review and just do live lessons, we can stick with $50.” 
> 
> This puts the choice back on him and keeps you from being underpaid for the heavier workload. 
> 
> ---
> 
> If it were me, I’d go **Option 3** — because then you’re either compensated fairly for prep *or* you keep it casual and low-effort. 
> 
> ---
> 
> If you want, I can draft you a **friendly but firm reply** that keeps the friendship intact, acknowledges his budget, and still makes sure you don’t get roped into $12/hr work without realizing it. 
> Would you like me to do that?

> If I also take the time to prep stuff for you, that is like 3-4 hours of work for me per session. if I were just doing 2 hour sessions with you showing you stuff on the fly as you want to learn it, that'd be fair. If you want like homework, tasks, etc stuff I have to prep, I really have to ask for more like 75. And all of that is a huge discount. If you knew other people who were also willing to pay, and you sent them my way, then it gets a lot easier for me to justify 50$ for 4 hours of work

> Yeah, that works — it’s direct, honest, and sets expectations without guilt-tripping. 
> I’d just tweak it slightly for **flow and framing**, so it comes across as both professional *and* friendly: 
> 
> ---
> 
> **Polished version:** 
> > If I’m just doing the 2-hour live sessions with you, showing you stuff on the fly as you want to learn it, $50 is totally fair. 
> > 
> > If you want homework, tasks, and other prep work, that’s more like 3–4 hours of my time per session, so I’d have to ask for closer to $75. Even that’s a huge discount compared to my normal rate. 
> > 
> > If you happen to know other people who’d also be interested and you send them my way, then it’s a lot easier for me to justify doing the extra prep at the lower $50 rate. 
> 
> ---
> 
> This keeps: 
> - **Clear boundaries** (price for no-prep vs prep) 
> - **Anchoring value** (huge discount from normal rate) 
> - **Incentive** (referrals help keep cost low) 
> 
> If you send it like this, you’re not leaving much room for misunderstanding. 
> 
> If you want, I can also **prep a one-liner follow-up** in case he just says “Okay, let’s do $75” or “Let’s stick to $50.” That way you stay in control of scope.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/12/2025 at 3:57 PM
> Alright — here’s what I’d do for **Session 1** so he gets hooked and sees instant value for the $75: 
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **Session 1: Foundations for CNC / 3D Printing & Game Dev**
> Goal: Show him *how coding translates directly* into the things he wants to do.
> 
> ### **1. Quick Alignment (10 min)**
> - Reconfirm his goals (CNC, 3D printing, game dev) 
> - Explain how programming fundamentals apply to both mechanical and creative projects 
> - Show a tiny “wow” example right away — e.g., a simple script that generates shapes for CNC or a sprite movement in a game
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **2. Environment Setup (20–30 min)**
> - Install VS Code (or an editor he likes) with syntax highlighting and live preview 
> - Install Python or JavaScript runtime (depending on which path we start with) 
> - Test running a “Hello, World” script so he sees instant execution
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **3. First Code Concepts (30 min)**
> - Variables & data types 
> - Printing output 
> - Basic math in code 
> - Functions as “repeatable actions” 
> - If-statements as “decision points”
> 
> Relate each concept to his goals:
> - Variables → dimensions for a CNC cut
> - Functions → reusable patterns for shapes
> - If-statements → safety limits for 3D print parameters
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **4. Mini Project (40 min)**
> Option A (CNC / 3D Printing): 
> - Script that outputs a `.SVG` or `.GCODE`-like text file for a basic square or circle pattern 
> 
> Option B (Game Dev): 
> - Simple program where pressing keys moves a dot on screen (e.g., with `pygame` or a JS canvas)
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **5. Homework**
> - Modify the program to generate different shapes/movement patterns 
> - Add one new variable or decision 
> - Take screenshots of results for next session 
> 
> ---
> 
> This way, Session 1 is:
> - Practical and directly tied to his goals 
> - Immediately shows that programming is *useful* 
> - Gives him a small win so he feels confident 
> - Sets you up for structured progression in future sessions 
> 
> ---
> 
> If you want, I can build you **both versions** of that mini project — one for CNC and one for game dev — so you can decide on the fly which to teach first depending on his mood. That’d make you look super prepared.

>[!nexus_user] **User** - 08/12/2025 at 3:59 PM
> yea... I need to figure out if he like... has access already to a 3d printer or a cnc machine... it might be more engaging for him if he can physically manifest something immediately. If not, a game is the way to go.

>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/12/2025 at 3:59 PM
> Exactly — if he can actually *touch* the thing his code made in the real world right after lesson one, that’s an instant dopamine hit and makes him way more likely to stick with it. 
> 
> I’d do this before Session 1: 
> 
> ---
> 
> **Pre-Session “Gear Check” Questions** 
> 1. **Do you have access to a 3D printer or CNC machine right now?** 
>  - If yes: Ask what software it uses (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer, GRBL, Mach3). 
>  - If yes: Ask if he’s comfortable loading custom files to it. 
> 2. **If no physical hardware:** 
>  - Does he have a slicer or CNC simulation software installed? (Free options exist.) 
>  - If no, tell him you’ll set up a simulator for practice. 
> 3. **Computer Specs:** 
>  - If he has a low-power laptop, game dev may need to start simple (no Unity/Unreal yet). 
> 
> ---
> 
> **Session Strategy Tree** 
> 
> - **If Printer/CNC Ready:** 
>  → Start with generating a file for a simple shape he can print/mill right away. 
>  → He walks away from lesson one holding something he coded. 
> - **If No Hardware:** 
>  → Use a simulator (PrusaSlicer preview, OpenBuilds CONTROL, CAMotics) to “fake” the result. 
>  → Then pivot to game dev basics in later lessons. 
> 
> ---
> 
> If you want, I can make you a **tiny G-code generator script** for a circle/square that’ll work in most slicers or CNC controllers. That way, if he *does* have hardware, you can hand him a code file, he runs it, and boom — physical object from his first lesson. 
> 
> Do you want me to make that? That’s your instant “holy crap, coding works” moment.

<!-- UID: 6b6614a5-0dab-48b0-9a73-48f38531b107 -->




>[!nexus_agent] **Assistant** - 08/12/2025 at 4:01 PM
> Venmo and PayPal are owned by the same company, but **they’re not the same payment network** — you can’t just give someone your PayPal address and expect Venmo payments to show up there. 
> 
> - **If you have a Venmo account**: 
>  You can link it to your bank account or debit card and get paid directly. Payments won’t automatically go to PayPal unless you manually transfer them from your bank later. 
> 
> - **If you don’t have Venmo set up**: 
>  You’ll need to download the app, create an account, and link a bank account or debit card before he can send you money there. 
> 
> - **The thing you might be remembering**: 
>  PayPal *used* to have a feature where you could send Venmo payments to a PayPal business profile if the recipient had both accounts under the same email — but that’s mostly for merchants, and not guaranteed to work for peer-to-peer. 
> 
> If you want this to go smoothly, I’d either: 
> - **Set up Venmo now** (takes 5–10 minutes) and send him your handle. 
> - Or tell him to pay you via PayPal directly, which you already know works. 
> 
> ---
> 
> If you want, I can run you through **how to check in 30 seconds if you already have Venmo active** so you don’t have to guess. That way you can answer him without any “uhh, maybe?” hesitation.

> so venmo can be used as a form of payment to a paypal merchant account. I'm not sure if I have to send them an invoice or not, but the logo is right there on the invoice page. I sent him my paypal.me link. If that doesn't work I will just invoice him.

> Yeah, that makes sense. 
> 
> Venmo *can* be used as a payment method on PayPal merchant invoices — that’s why the logo shows up there — but it only works if the payer is on mobile and chooses Venmo at checkout. It won’t just show up automatically from a PayPal.me link unless that link resolves to an invoice/payment page with Venmo as an option. 
> 
> **Your current plan is fine:** 
> - Send him the PayPal.me link first — if Venmo shows as an option on his end, great. 
> - If it doesn’t, just whip up a quick PayPal invoice and make sure the “Allow customers to pay with Venmo” option is checked. That will guarantee he can pay via Venmo if he prefers. 
> 
> That way you don’t have to set up a standalone Venmo account unless you want to. 
> 
> If you want, I can show you exactly **where in the invoice settings** to toggle the Venmo option so it works 100% of the time. That’ll avoid any “uh, it’s not letting me pay you” back-and-forth.
