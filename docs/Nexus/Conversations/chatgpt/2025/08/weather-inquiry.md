> Here’s your 7-day weather outlook for Minneapolis—no need to juggle numbers, it’s all in the widget above. Here's the short, useful take:
> 
> - **Today (Thursday, August 21)**: Mostly sunny and humid, with a high around 82 °F (28 °C) and a low near 68 °F (20 °C).
> - **Friday**: Cloudier, slightly cooler highs (~76 °F / 25 °C), but watch for thunderstorms—and potentially hail or damaging winds.
> - **Weekend**: Saturday and Sunday bring a crisp shift—a breezy, partly sunny Saturday (high ~68 °F / 20 °C), followed by a cooler Sunday (mid-60s °F / mid-teens °C) that offers a real hint of fall.
> - **Early Next Week**: Temperatures rebound into the upper 60s to low 70s °F (20–22 °C). Monday through Wednesday promise mostly pleasant skies and moderate warmth.

> 
> ### Quick Tips Based on the Forecast:
> 
> - **Dress layers**: Morning humidity and warmth may call for short sleeves, but the weekend cool-down means a light jacket or sweater will be handy.
> - **Be storm-aware Friday**: Stay alert—scattered thunderstorms could bring gusts or hail. Check local updates if you’ll be out midday.
> - **Grip onto summer’s end**: Saturday looks like a great day for hiking, biking, or outdoor plans before fall’s cooler mood settles in.
