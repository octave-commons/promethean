> ​The **Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool (BRAT)** is a plugin for Obsidian that streamlines the process of installing and updating beta versions of other plugins and themes directly from their GitHub repositories. This is particularly useful for developers and testers who want to experiment with the latest features before they're officially released.
