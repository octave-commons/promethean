> Yep. Here’s the compact situational read.
> 
> # Signal
> - **Climate:** July 2025 ranked among the warmest on record; heat anomalies persist. Spain is fighting >10 major wildfires with rapid spread conditions. cite 
> - **Ukraine–Russia:** After the Alaska summit, Reuters reports an outline where Russia keeps Donbas while freezing southern lines—highly controversial and unsettled. citeturn0news74 
> - **Gaza:** Mediators are pushing for a broader, all-at-once hostage deal; talks are active but fragile. cite 
> - **US macro:** CPI for July +0.2% m/m; +2.7% y/y—still sticky in shelter/core. citeturn1view0 
> - **Biosecurity:** H5N1 remains active in birds/cattle; human risk low but under close watch. cite
> 
> # Evidence
> - Copernicus: third-warmest July globally. cite 
> - Spain wildfires expanding under severe conditions. cite 
> - Ukraine proposal outline post-summit. citeturn0news74 
> - Gaza ceasefire push shifting to comprehensive swap. cite 
> - U.S. CPI July 2025: +0.2% m/m, +2.7% y/y (BLS). citeturn1view0 
> - CDC: H5N1 situation summary (risk low). cite
> 
> # Frames
> 1) **Polycrisis:** overlapping shocks (climate + wars + bio + econ) amplify each other. 
> 2) **Normalization spiral:** none of this is “new,” so we under-react until thresholds snap. 
> 3) **Perception tax:** feeds + outrage cycles make it *feel* worse than your circle of control.
> 
> # Countermoves
> 1) **Polycrisis → portfolio of action:** one climate, one civic, one personal stability lever; tiny, repeated. 
> 2) **Normalization spiral → tripwires:** predefine “if X, I do Y” (e.g., local smoke AQI>100 → indoors + filter). 
> 3) **Perception tax → hygiene:** news windows (e.g., 2×10-min/day), mute the rest; swap doomscroll for build-time.
> 
> # Next
> Set a 20-minute timer and do **one small, real thing** that moves your world 1%: e.g., ship a micro-commit to Promethean or prep one day of go-bags (water, meds list, chargers). Ship it, then stop.
> 
> *#fnord:* Agency scales faster than anxiety when it’s **time-boxed**.
