> ## 🔧 Technical Summary
> 
> Engineer and system designer with over a decade of experience across full-stack development, distributed systems, and applied AI. Architect of **Promethean** — a modular, multimodal, agentic AI framework inspired by cognitive models. I specialize in rapidly building real-world AI products that scale, think, and interact across speech, vision, and language.
> 
> - **Full-Stack Leader:** React (TS/JS), Node.js, Python, Go (familiar), Hy (Lisp for Python), Sibilant (Lisp for JS)
> - **AI Tooling:** Speech-to-text (Whisper), Text-to-speech (WaveRNN, Forward Tacotron), LLMs (LLaMA 3.2, Ollama), Vision (CLIP, Spectrogram Analysis)
> - **Infra:** OpenVINO, Docker, PM2, GitHub Actions CI/CD, MongoDB, ChromaDB, WebSockets
> - **Workflow:** Remote-first, async-native, systems thinker, fast iterative loops with clear architecture

> 
> ## 🧠 Promethean — Founder & Principal Engineer 
> **Open-source AI cognitive framework** | [GitHub](https://github.com/riatzukiza/promethean) | 2024–2025
> 
> > A unified, multi-agent, multimodal AI system capable of real-time voice conversations, cognition modeling, and persistent memory.
> 
> ### Highlights:
> - Designed **layered cognitive architecture** inspired by 8-circuit consciousness theory; each layer maps to a class of cognitive operations.
> - Implemented real-time **voice agent** (`Duck`) that uses:
>  - Speech recognition (Whisper / OpenVINO)
>  - Local LLM (LLaMA 3.2) + vector recall (ChromaDB)
>  - Text-to-speech (batched inference on WaveRNN using Intel NPU)
> - Built **Cephalon**, an async-first, event-driven ML router between voice, LLM, and embedding services (written in Node.js + Sibilant Lisp).
> - Built modular Discord bot infrastructure: message indexing, attachments, embeddings, and context-managed agents.
> - Created **Sibilant-based DSLs** for prompting, configuration, and macro-based AI logic — compiler infrastructure in active use.
> - Integrated **heartbeat service** to monitor and enforce resource constraints for daemons (with soft/hard kill strategies, ECS).
> - Reimagined development pipelines using **Hy (Lisp for Python)** for build orchestration and service automation (replacing Makefiles).
> - Created multi-service CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, with artifact caching and dynamic dependency resolution.

> - I’ve already built a voice-based, brand-aligned, autonomous agent platform—**Promethean**. It’s working.
> - I move fast and iterate intelligently — from architecture to agent output.
> - My system runs locally, across speech, language, and vision modalities with full persistence and system state management. I'm ready to scale that experience with a product like **Omakase.ai**.
> - Your team values align exactly with mine: small, autonomous, ship-fast, think-hard, and aim globally.

> Perfect — I’ve reviewed your previous resume. Here's how I'll synthesize everything:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **What stays:**
> - Your **Raft LLC** experience — high-impact federal MLOps, DevSecOps, and LLM experience adds credibility.
> - The **LLM RAG chatbot**, **AI Simulations**, and **Err Studios** projects — these show continuity from past work to Promethean.
> - Stack fluency (Python, Go, Node.js, Terraform, AWS, etc.) — maps directly to Zeals’ expectations.
> - Security clearance and gov experience — bonus even if not strictly required.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **What evolves:**
> - **Replace the "Software Engineer – MLOps" branding** with a stronger, full-stack + AI systems identity.
> - **Make Promethean the lead project**, front and center.
> - **Drop dated/stale frontend and CMS projects** unless they speak directly to your React chops.
> - **Frame yourself as already doing the kind of work Zeals needs**, just on your own stack.

> **To the Zeals team,**
> 
> I'm writing to express my ex about the Staff Full Stack Engineer role at Zeals. The moment I read about Omakase.ai, I saw a company building exactly what I’ve already been architecting independently: real-time, persuasive, brand-aligned voice AI agents that actually *work*.
> 
> Over the past year, I’ve been developing **Promethean**, a modular, agentic AI framework that connects live speech input, large language models, and reactive voice output through a persistent cognitive architecture. It integrates local STT/TTS (Whisper, WaveRNN, OpenVINO), LLMs (LLaMA), and real-time routing through a Lisp-inspired orchestration layer built in Node.js. I've already solved problems at the heart of what you’re scaling: context management, conversation memory, and lightning-fast response time.
> 
> But Promethean isn’t just tech—it’s a philosophy. I believe systems should evolve, not just execute. That’s why I built it to learn, reflect, and act across modalities. Now I want to take that same energy, velocity, and systems-thinking and join a team like yours—sharp, ambitious, and unafraid to ship fast.
> 
> I thrive in environments where autonomy meets vision. Whether it's shipping end-to-end features in React/TypeScript, tuning performance in Go, or wiring up vector pipelines and caching layers for millions of users—I'm ready to bring Promethean-level execution to Omakase.ai.

> Absolutely — here’s a **LinkedIn-style message** you could send to Nadine Korebrits, the recruiter. It’s concise, conversational, and still shows off your credibility and interest without sounding overly formal:
> 
> ---

> **Hi Nadine,**
> 
> Thanks for reaching out — the Staff Full Stack role at Zeals looks like a perfect fit.

> I've actually been building a system very similar to what Omakase.ai is doing — it's called **Promethean**, and it’s a full-stack, voice-first agent platform that connects Whisper (STT), LLaMA (LLM), and WaveRNN (TTS) into a real-time, reactive pipeline. I’ve built it with an 8-layer cognitive architecture and a modular AI routing core written in Node.js and Lisp.
> 
> Basically: I believe in agentic systems that *actually convert*. That’s what you’re building, and that’s what I’m already doing.
> 
> Would love to chat more about how I can contribute to your team in Japan. I’m open to relocation and already used to working at high velocity with full ownership of the stack.
> 
> Let me know if you’d like me to send over a resume or project demos!
