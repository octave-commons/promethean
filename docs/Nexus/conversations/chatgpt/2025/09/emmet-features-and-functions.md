> ​Emmet is a powerful toolkit designed to streamline HTML and CSS coding by allowing developers to write concise abbreviations that expand into full-fledged code snippets. Originally known as Zen Coding, Emmet is open-source and licensed under the MIT License.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔧 Core Features
> 
> - **Abbreviation Expansion**: Emmet enables you to write shorthand expressions that resemble CSS selectors, which then expand into complete HTML structures. For example:
> 
>  ```emmet
>  ul#nav>li.item$*3>a{Item $}
>  ```
> 
>  
> Expands to:
> 
>  ```html
>  <ul id="nav">
>  <li class="item1"><a href="">Item 1</a></li>
>  <li class="item2"><a href="">Item 2</a></li>
>  <li class="item3"><a href="">Item 3</a></li>
>  </ul>
>  ```
> 
> - **Dynamic Snippets**: Unlike static code snippets, Emmet's abbreviations are dynamic and context-aware, allowing for more flexible and efficient coding.
> 
> - **CSS Abbreviations**: Emmet supports abbreviations for CSS properties, enabling quick generation of styles. For instance, `m10-20` expands to `margin: 10px 20px;`.
> 
> - **Multi-Editor Support**: Emmet is compatible with various text editors, including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and more.
>
