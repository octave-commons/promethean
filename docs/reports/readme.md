# 📊 Reports Folder

This folder holds **reports generated by infrastructure agents**, especially Embedding & Index agents.

## Purpose
- Collect contradictions, overlaps, and semantic summaries.
- Provide human + AI visibility into epistemic tensions in the system.

## Contents
- $[docs/reports/contradictions.md|contradictions.md]$ → central contradictions log.

## Workflow
- Generated by Embedding Agents via `/index`, `/update`, `/search`, `/grep`.
- Updated automatically when contradictions are found.
