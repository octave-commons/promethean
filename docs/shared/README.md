# Shared Library Documentation

Docs for code in the `shared/` directory. These utilities are reused across services and agents and are organized by language.

## Layout
- py – Python helpers such as `shared/py/settings.py` and service clients.
- ts – TypeScript libraries such as `shared/ts/prom-lib`.
- js, hy, sibilant – reserved for future shared modules.

Add documentation alongside new shared components to explain their responsibilities and interfaces.
