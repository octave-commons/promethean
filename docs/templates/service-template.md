# Service Template

The Promethean repository includes a reusable service template to help you bootstrap new services and keep documentation consistent.

## Files

- `docs/templates/service.README.template.md` – skeleton README for new service docs.
- `services/templates` – boilerplate resources for service implementations.

## Usage

1. Copy `docs/templates/service.README.template.md` into `docs/services/<service>/README.md`.
2. Replace `{{SERVICE_NAME}}` and fill in details such as purpose, usage, and file references.
3. Mirror your service’s code structure under `services/<service>` and keep docs in sync.

Following this template ensures a uniform layout across Promethean services.
