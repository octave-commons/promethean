# Testing Status Review — 2025-01-10

We reviewed every task that was still marked `testing` in the kanban set and aligned each record with its actual state. None of the tasks had current validation evidence; most were either unstarted slices or placeholder templates. Status updates were applied directly in the task frontmatter and the table below captures the rationale for each change.

| Task | Updated Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[add_twitch_chat_integration]] | breakdown | Document still calls out a blocker and lacks an owner; needs a clarified restart before implementation. |
| [[enso-handshake-guard-env-timeout-and-cache]] | todo | Requirements are clear and ready to execute once picked up. |
| [[expand-functional-loop-refactors]] | todo | Planning notes exist but no work has begun. |
| [[docker-compose-edn-template-system]] | breakdown | File only contains templater output; needs a proper task write-up. |
| [[kubernetes-configurations-for-secure-distributed-deployment-on-local-net]] | todo | Actionable plan captured; simply not started. |
| [[move-discord-scraper-to-ts]] | todo | Scope is defined and unblocked; awaiting execution. |
| [[lisp-package-files]] | ready | Requirements and context are solid; ready to prioritize next. |
| [[format_auth_service_readme_with_prettier]] | todo | Simple formatting fix remains outstanding. |
| [[structural-code-editing-ai-tool-that-uses-tree-diffs-instead-of-string-based-universal-diffs--ensuring-generated-results-are-always-immediately-validatable]] | breakdown | Oversized R&D slice that now needs decomposition across the smaller follow-up tasks. |
| [[agent-safe-stablization-after-big-moves]] | todo | Detailed stabilization checklist but no execution yet. |
| [[kanban-cli-cljs-quickstart]] | accepted | Concept write-up is captured; needs further breakdown before moving to delivery. |
| [[Setup Identity Experiment]] | accepted | Research framing only; requires design refinement prior to implementation. |
| [[discord_image_awareness]] | breakdown | Conflicting status notes and missing acceptance criteria; needs clarification. |
| [[fp-ts-config-and-linting]] | breakdown | Placeholder templater output without actionable content. |
| [[organize-tooling-packages]] | todo | Inventory and plan prepared; work has not started. |

| [[pr-688-nitpack-extract]] | todo | Deliverables and workflow defined; awaiting execution. |
| [[design-vision-pipeline-mvp]] | breakdown | Another template stub that needs a proper design outline. |
| [[evaluate-ollama-openvino]] | todo | Evaluation plan drafted; work not yet in motion. |
