## 🛠️ Task: Replace Makefile agent commands with pnpm scripts

The earlier plan called for agent-specific Makefile targets such as `make start:duck`. The audit showed those never shipped,
and the active tooling already relies on pnpm workspaces (`scripts/dev.mjs`, `pnpm --filter …`). Rather than reviving the
Makefile, we will publish pnpm scripts that mirror the desired ergonomics.

## ✅ Decision
- Standardize on pnpm workspace scripts and `scripts/dev.mjs` for agent lifecycle management.
- Remove references to `%`-style Makefile dispatch and instead document `pnpm --filter @promethean/<agent> dev|test` patterns.

## 🔍 Findings from audit
- No maintained agent workflows depend on `Makefile`/`Makefile.hy`.
- Existing developers start services via `pnpm dev:all` (scripts/dev.mjs) or direct package scripts.
- Documentation still directs contributors to non-existent Makefile targets.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Provide agent-scoped start/test commands via pnpm scripts.
- Document how to launch an individual agent without Makefile wrappers.
- Supply a concrete example (e.g., Duck) showing the new commands.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [ ] Add workspace scripts or README snippets mapping agents to `pnpm --filter` commands.
- [ ] Ensure `scripts/dev.mjs` coverage is documented for multi-agent dev loops.
- [ ] Update root onboarding docs to drop Makefile references.

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [ ] Inventory existing agent packages and confirm they expose `dev`/`test` scripts.
- [ ] Publish documented aliases (e.g., `pnpm agent:duck:dev`) if gaps exist.
- [ ] Update README / docs to reflect pnpm usage only.
