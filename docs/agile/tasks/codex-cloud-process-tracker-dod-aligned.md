# Codex Cloud — Process Tracker DoD-aligned

This single doc tracks every checkbox from your request and our Definition of Done. I’ll keep it append-only (new dated logs at the bottom) and tick items only when they’re truly achieved.

## Master Tasks

### 1) Identify contradictions between the board, the workflow prompt, the process doc, and AGENTS.md

* [ ] the board — **pending** (need current board source; see Next actions)
* [ ] workflow prompt system\_prompt.md — contradictions noted
* [ ] process document — contradictions noted
* [ ] AGENTS.md — contradictions noted

* Status driver conflict (hashtags vs front‑matter), incomplete hashtag set, WIP rules missing in prompt, stage label inconsistencies, and board/edit direction mismatch captured.

### 2) Identify unclear elements

* [ ] instructions — clarified
* [ ] descriptions — clarified
* [ ] transitions — clarified added entry/exit criteria
* [ ] rules — clarified hashtags are canonical, WIP = Σ(score)

### 3) Suggest changes to the **process document** to reflect reality (and board)

* [ ] Drafted changes: canonical hashtag set; estimation schema complexity/scale/time\_hours ⇒ score; WIP by Σ(score) with defaults; Pro
