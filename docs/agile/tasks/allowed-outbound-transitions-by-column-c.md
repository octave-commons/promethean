## 📝 Context Summary

awesome—here’s the **concise transition spec** to pair with the mermaid FSM you just approved. it’s strictly procedural, agent-agnostic, and keeps rules minimal.

# Allowed outbound transitions by column C → …

> General rule: a transition to a target **fails** if that target’s WIP cap is reached. Each task has **one** status at a time.

## 🧊 Ice Box

**Trigger:** revisited/prioritized now worth re-intake.

## 💭 Incoming

* → Accepted: clear project relevance; worth exploring.
* → Rejected: out of scope / duplicate / not actionable.
* → Ice Box: deferrable; valuable later.

## ✅ Accepted

* → Breakdown: ready to analyze/shape.
* → Ice Box: deferrable after quick review not urgent/connected.

## 🧩 Breakdown

**C →** Ready, Rejected, Ice Box, Blocked

* → Ready: scoped, traceable acceptance notes, basic feasibility OK.
* → Rejected: becomes non-viable / dup / obsolete.
* → Ice Box: valid but lower priority; defer consciously.
* → Blocked: dependency/constraint discovered that stops analysis.

## 🛠 Ready

* → To Do: prioritized into the execution queue.
* → Blocked: prerequisite missing (env, dependency, policy).

## 🟢 To Do

* → In Progress: pulled by a worker (WIP allows).
* →
