# Resolve ESLint violations across repository

## Description
Multiple packages trigger ESLint errors such as `functional/prefer-immutable-types`, `functional/no-let`, and other functional rules. Inline disables have started appearing, but we prefer configuration changes or code refactors over ad‑hoc ignores.

## Goals
- Audit the entire repo for ESLint failures.
- Remove or minimize inline `eslint-disable` comments.
- Update [[eslint.config.ts]] to reflect agreed rule adjustments.
- Document complex rule decisions for future contributors.

## Requirements
- Run `pnpm lint` in a CI-like environment.
- Group violations by rule and propose fixes.
- Prefer config updates or pattern changes over blanket disables.
- Record any rules that remain unmet with rationale.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Execute repository-wide lint and capture all rule failures.
- [ ] Categorize issues and identify recurring patterns.
- [ ] Draft config changes in [[eslint.config.ts]] to address systemic problems.
- [ ] Refactor code or add utilities where patterns recur.
- [ ] Create documentation summarizing unresolved or complex rules.

# Session Notes (2025-10-09)

## Clarification & Scope
- Target a small subset of ESLint errors that block repository linting, focusing on actionable rule violations instead of configuration overhauls.
- Avoid global rule relaxations; prefer localized refactors in the offending packages.

## Plan
1. Run linting on the affected package(s) to capture the exact violations.
2. Refactor code to satisfy the functional lint rules (e.g., eliminate `let`, enforce immutability, prefer pure helpers).
3. Re-run targeted lint commands to verify the fixes.
4. Record any remaining blockers or systemic issues for follow-up.

## Risks / Open Questions
- The repository-level lint run currently fails before reporting violations due to dependency mismatches; may need to update/install dependencies first.
- Some lint rules may require broader architectural changes; will document if encountered instead of over-scoping this slice.
