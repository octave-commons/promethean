The local harness for `@promethean/cephalon` spins up an `EnsoServer`, but no router handler forwards `tool.call` envelopes to
the agent client. Without a handler the router drops those messages, so tests waiting for `tool.result` never observe a
response and time out.

## Background
- `pnpm nx test @promethean/cephalon` currently stalls on tool execution specs.
- Production deployments rely on explicit routing, but the lightweight test harness never implemented it.

## Exit Criteria
- Register a router handler (or equivalent) so local tool calls reach the agent's `EnsoClient`.
- Confirm tool invocations emit matching `tool.result` responses under the test harness.
- Add regression coverage that fails if tool calls are not forwarded.
