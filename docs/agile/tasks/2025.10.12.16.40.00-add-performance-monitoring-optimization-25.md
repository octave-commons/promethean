## Task Breakdown Complete

This task has been broken down into 6 focused subtasks:

### P1 Subtasks (Critical Path):

1. **Add Performance Metrics Collection Library** (8 points) - Core metrics infrastructure
2. **Implement Benchmarking Suite with Criterium** (5 points) - Performance regression testing
3. **Create Performance Monitoring Middleware** (5 points) - HTTP request monitoring

### P2 Subtasks (Enhancement):

4. **Add Profiling Tools and Utilities** (6 points) - Development profiling support
5. **Implement Observability and Tracing** (8 points) - Distributed tracing
6. **Build Performance Dashboards** (6 points) - Visualization and monitoring

## Implementation Strategy:

- **Phase 1**: Metrics collection and benchmarking (P1 items 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Middleware and basic monitoring (P1 item 3)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced observability (P2 items 4-6)

## Dependencies:

- All subtasks depend on the metrics collection library
- Dashboard development depends on observability implementation
- Middleware can be developed in parallel with other components
