Evaluate scripts like add-license-to-packages.js, fix-bins.js, append-js-extensions.js, and other one-time maintenance tools. Document which ones should be kept as maintenance utilities vs deprecated. Create clear documentation for their proper use cases and mark as deprecated for regular development.
