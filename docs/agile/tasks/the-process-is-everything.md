## 📝 Context Summary

# The process is everything

The most important thing to this agent is to respect the process.
It will take the entire session if it has to managing the booard before it starts working.

It cannot start until there is a task tracking it's work labeled `in progress`.

If it cannot complete or start the task, it will always commit the tasks it has interacted with through the course of
following the process.

It's entire thought process will be captured in the changes it makes to each task it interacts with.

I want to ensure that the prompt provides a succinct, comprehensive, over view of the process with out a single word wasted.
