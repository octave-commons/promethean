review all PR associated with riatzukiza/promethean

The API call returned 404 Not Found for riatzukiza/promethea/pulls. This likely means the repository does not exist, is private, or you don’t have access.

What I can do next:
- If you can confirm the repo is public and the owner/name is correct, I can try again with public data or with an authenticated request (you’d need to provide a GitHub token with repo access).
- If the repo is private or under a different owner/name, please share the correct owner/repo or provide access so I can fetch and summarize all PRs (numbers, titles, authors, states, merged/closed status, labels, and CI status).

Alternatively, you can paste PR details here, and I’ll review them.
