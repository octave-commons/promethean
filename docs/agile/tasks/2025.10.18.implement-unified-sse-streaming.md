## 📡 Implement Unified SSE Streaming

### 📋 Description

Implement unified Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming capabilities that provide real-time updates for all collections and data changes across the unified package. This involves consolidating existing SSE implementations, enhancing connection management, and providing consistent event filtering and routing.

### 🎯 Goals

- Unified SSE streaming for all data collections
- Robust client connection management
- Event filtering and routing capabilities
- Cross-language event system integration
- Performance optimization for high-volume streaming

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server-sent events for all collections
- [ ] Client connection management with heartbeat
- [ ] Event filtering and routing system
- [ ] Cross-language event bus integration
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Comprehensive testing coverage

### 🔧 Technical Specifications

#### SSE Components to Implement:

1. **Core SSE Server**

   - Fastify SSE plugin integration
   - Connection lifecycle management
   - Event broadcasting system
   - Client subscription management

2. **Event System**

   - Unified event bus architecture
   - Event type definitions and schemas
   - Event filtering and routing logic
   - Cross-language event propagation

3. **Connection Management**

   - Client authentication and authorization
   - Connection health monitoring
   - Automatic reconnection handling
   - Load balancing and scaling

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Event batching and compression
   - Connection pooling
   - Memory management for high-volume streams
   - Metrics and monitoring
