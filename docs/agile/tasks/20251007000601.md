## 📝 Context Summary

Cool, ambitious vision. Let me push back, poke holes, and sketch a scaffolding. If you accept the roughness, we can then refine each piece into a “Pantheon” prototype.

Your goal: get “cloud-model quality” via a compositional graph of small, hyper-specialized agents, orchestrated in pipelines, learning and refining tasks overnight, waking to PRs & reviews. Locally. With a tool/CLI/framework for defining agents, flows, training data, etc.

That is very hard, but not impossible in principle. You’re trying to build a **system of agents + orchestration + recursive improvement + specialization + scheduling**. It is in some ways like combining:

* agent orchestration / multi-agent systems
* model distillation / specialization
* scheduling & offline training pipelines
* feedback loops / continual learning
* system definition / declarative DSL for flows

Here’s how I’d break it down — with warnings, tradeoffs, and a rough architecture sketch. After, I’ll propose a toy “Pantheon” blueprint (with CLI, agent spec, flow graph) and we can iterate.

## Challenges & trade-offs (you need to accept some compromises)

Before designing, be clear on what you’re asking for and where you’ll hit wal
