## 📝 Context Summary

Love it. Let’s make this practical: build a few Qwen3 variants (quant + context tweaks), then run (1) a coding benchmark that’s respected and easy to run locally (HumanEval/MBPP via **EvalPlus**) and (2) a **tool-use** benchmark that’s become the default for function-calling (**BFCL**). I’m giving you a single Bash script that does the whole loop.

A couple of facts before the code (so you know I’m not hand-waving):

* **EvalPlus** has a native **Ollama backend**; you just point it at `http://localhost:11434/v1` and it works. ([GitHub][1])
* **BFCL** ships a `bfcl` CLI. It can talk to **pre-existing OpenAI-compatible endpoints** (skip server setup & set endpoint/port), which is exactly what Ollama exposes at `/v1`. We’ll run the “prompt” (non-native FC) track to avoid hard OpenAI‐style tool schemas, which Ollama doesn’t implement natively yet. ([PyPI][2])
* To squeeze more into VRAM: (a) quantize the *weights* when creating the model (`ollama create --quantize q4_K_M|q5_K_M|q8_0`), and (b) quantize the **KV cache** with `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE` (e.g., `q8_0`), ideally with Flash Attention on. You can also bump default context with `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`. ([ollama.readthedocs.io][3])
