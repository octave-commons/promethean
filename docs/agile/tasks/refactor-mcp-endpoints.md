## Context
- **What changed?**: Need to extend MCP transport loader to support multiple HTTP endpoints from config.
- **Where?**: `packages/mcp`
- **Why now?**: Enables testing different MCP tool sets while sharing one package build.

## Inputs / Artifacts
- `promethean.mcp.json`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Config schema accepts endpoint map for HTTP transports.
- [ ] MCP HTTP server registers each configured endpoint with its toolset.
- [ ] Tests cover multi-endpoint configuration.
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed.

## Plan
1. Inspect current MCP package configuration parsing.
2. Update configuration types and loader to accept `endpoints` map.
3. Adjust HTTP server composition to register multiple routers.
4. Add tests verifying configuration and runtime wiring.
