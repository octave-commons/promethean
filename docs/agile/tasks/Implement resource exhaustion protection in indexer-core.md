recovery mechanisms between stages and improve error reporting throughout the @promethean/simtasks processing pipeline.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 📋 Description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis task addresses the error handling gaps identified in the code review. Currently there are limited error recovery mechanisms between processing stages, which can lead to silent failures and poor debugging experience.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 🔍 Scope\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Files to be updated:**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- 01-scan.ts (file scanning and validation)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- 02-embed.ts (embedding generation failures)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- 03-cluster.ts (clustering algorithm failures)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- 04-plan.ts (planning failures)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- 05-write.ts (task writing failures)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 📝 Acceptance Criteria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Error handling implemented for all processing stages\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Graceful degradation when individual stages fail\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Detailed error messages with context for debugging\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms prevent complete pipeline failure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Error types properly classified and handled\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Logging provides sufficient context for troubleshooting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 🎯 Story Points: 8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Breakdown:**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement error handling in scan stage (01-scan.ts): 2 points\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement error handling in embed stage (02-embed.ts): 2 points\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement error handling in cluster stage (03-cluster.ts): 2 points\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement error handling in plan and write stages: 2 points\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 🚧 Implementation Strategy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Error Classification\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Define error types for different failure scenarios\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create custom error classes for better error handling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement error severity levels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Stage-Specific Error Handling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Scan Stage:** File system errors, permission issues, invalid inputs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Embed Stage:** API failures, rate limiting, embedding generation errors\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Cluster Stage:** Algorithm failures, data validation errors\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Plan Stage:** Logic errors, data transformation failures\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Write Stage:** File write errors, permission issues, output validation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Recovery Mechanisms\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement retry logic for transient failures\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add fallback mechanisms for non-critical failures\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create error recovery strategies for each stage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Logging and Monitoring\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add structured logging with appropriate severity levels\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement error tracking and reporting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create debugging information for troubleshooting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Risk:** Over-engineering error handling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Mitigation:** Focus on practical error scenarios and recovery\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Risk:** Performance impact from extensive error checking\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Mitigation:** Balance error handling with performance requirements\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Risk:** Complex error recovery logic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Mitigation:** Keep recovery mechanisms simple and reliable\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 📚 Dependencies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Should be completed after type safety and complexity improvements\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Prerequisite for comprehensive testing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Enables better production reliability\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 🧪 Testing Requirements\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- All existing tests must continue to pass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Add error scenario tests for each processing stage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Integration tests to verify error recovery mechanisms\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Performance tests to ensure error handling doesn't impact performance\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## 🔧 Error Handling Patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nImplement consistent error handling patterns:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Try-catch blocks with specific error types\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Error propagation with context preservation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Graceful degradation strategies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Comprehensive logging and monitoring\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    sha: \\\\\\\"fdaf13a255dc9f2a649f2d047dbbfd8f01aaa1d5\\\\\\\"\\\\n+    timestamp: \\\\\\\"2025-10-19 17:07:27 -0500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndiff --git a/docs/agile/tasks/Implement
