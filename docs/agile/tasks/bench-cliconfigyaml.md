## 📝 Context Summary

awesome—let’s lock this into a real, repeatable framework you can drop into your monorepo. i’ll give you:

* the **suite** to run (coding, tool-use, vision, knowledge)
* the **SDK shape** (TypeScript, ESM, AVA) for custom benchmarks
* a **config** that targets your 8 GB VRAM reality (Gemma3 “tools”, Gemma3n Tools, MiniCPM-V 4.5) + remote judges (OpenRouter / Z.ai)
* the boring-but-critical **repro & security knobs**

I’m grounding every claim to working docs/tools so you’re not chasing vibes.

## what we’re standardizing on

* **Tool-calling:** BFCL (Berkeley Function Calling). It’s an executable function-calling eval with a maintained CLI (`bfcl-eval`) that can talk to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including **Ollama’s `/v1`**. Use the “prompt” track for generic instruct models, and FC track if the model natively supports OpenAI tools. ([PyPI][1])
* **Coding:** Aider **Polyglot** (225 Exercism problems). It ships a Docker harness and supports **Ollama via `ollama_chat/<model>`**. This is the coding eval Unsloth itself uses for Dynamic GGUF claims. ([Aider][2])
* **Vision (local):** **MiniCPM-V 4.5** (Ollama card + GH docs). Good single-image VLM that will run on consumer ri
