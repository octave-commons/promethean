## 🛠️ Description

I want for discord agents to be able to join channels, leave channels, send messages (In channels and in DMs), etc all automaticly in a sort of "full  agent mode"

I don't want him spamming messages or tts, I want him to be doing things in the background (curating context, guiding other simpler agent flows like the webcrawler )
