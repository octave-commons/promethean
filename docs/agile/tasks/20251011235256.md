# Implement Git Tag Management and Scar History

## Overview

This task involves implementing git tag management and scar history functionality for the kanban heal command. The implementation should provide robust version tracking and historical context for kanban board operations.

## Requirements

### Git Tag Management

- Create and manage git tags for kanban board states
- Support semantic versioning for tags
- Tag creation automation for significant board changes
- Tag listing and filtering capabilities
- Tag deletion and cleanup functionality

### Scar History

- Track historical changes to kanban board
- Maintain a "scar" record of board modifications
- Provide rollback capabilities to previous board states
- Generate change logs and diff reports
- Support for board state comparison

### Kanban Heal Integration

- Integrate tag management with the existing kanban heal command
- Provide healing capabilities using tagged board states
- Support for selective healing based on tag selection
- Automated healing using the most recent stable tag

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Tag Manager** - Handle git tag operations
2. **Scar History Manager** - Track board state changes
3. **Heal Integration** - Extend existing heal command
4. **CLI Commands** - New and extended command line interfaces

### Technical Approach

- Use existing git utilities and libraries
- Leverage the current kanban system architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Git tags can be created for board states
- [ ] Scar history tracks all board modifications
- [ ] Kanban heal command can use tagged states
- [ ] CLI commands work as expected
- [ ] All functionality is properly tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Dependencies

- Existing kanban system
- Git utilities
- CLI framework
- Testing infrastructure

## Notes

This is a critical enhancement to the kanban system that will provide better version control and recovery capabilities for board management.
