## 🛠️ Task: Create vault-config .obsidian with Kanban and minimal vault setup

Provide a shareable `.obsidian` folder that new contributors can copy to get the
same Kanban board and plugin configuration. Keep the config minimal so it works
across different operating systems.
Provide a small example of an Obsidian configuration so contributors can quickly
spin up the same vault environment. The config should enable the Kanban plugin
and include a `README` explaining how to copy the folder into `.obsidian/`.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Include the Kanban plugin as the only required community plugin
- Document how to copy the config into a fresh clone
- Supply a ready-to-copy `.obsidian` folder under `vault-config/`.
- Document how to copy the folder and what plugins are enabled.
- Keep the configuration minimal so personal settings remain local.
