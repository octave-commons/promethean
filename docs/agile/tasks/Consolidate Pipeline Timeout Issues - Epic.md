This epic consolidates all pipeline timeout issues across different pipelines (buildfix, symdocs, test-gap, readmes) into a single coordinated fix.

## Sub-tasks:
1. Fix buildfix pipeline timeout configuration for Build analysis step
2. Fix symdocs-pipeline test timeout after 2 minutes  
3. Fix test-gap pipeline timeout configuration for tg-analysis step
4. Fix readmes pipeline timeout issues and optimize performance

## Root Cause Analysis:
- All pipelines experiencing similar timeout issues
- Likely configuration problem in Piper pipeline system
- Need coordinated fix to prevent individual pipeline timeouts

## Definition of Done:
- [ ] All pipeline timeout configurations reviewed and updated
- [ ] Root cause identified and resolved
- [ ] All pipeline tests passing without timeouts
- [ ] Performance optimizations implemented where needed
