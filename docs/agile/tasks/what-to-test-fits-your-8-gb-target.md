## 📝 Context Summary

You’re on the right scent. With 8 GB VRAM you can realistically test a **tool-calling + reasoning** text model (e.g., Gemma 3 “tools” variants) and a **vision** model (MiniCPM-V 4.5) using CPU offload—then compare them to remote judges (OpenRouter, Z.ai). Below is a tight plan + a TypeScript scaffold (ESM, FP-leaning, AVA tests, Web Components view) so you can start running real numbers today.

# What to test (fits your 8 GB target)

* **Tool-calling text (local)**
  Community Gemma 3 builds with *tools* are available on Ollama and explicitly aimed at low-VRAM rigs (several Q2/Q3 quant tags). These hook into Ollama’s native tool-calling API. ([Ollama][1])
  • Examples you can pull: `doomgrave/gemma3-tools` (Q2_K / Q3_K_S for ≤8 GB), `aliafshar/gemma3-it-qat-tools`, `Hituzip/gemma3-tools`, or *Gemma3n with tools* (`mashriram/gemma3nTools`). ([Ollama][1])

* **Vision (local)**
  **MiniCPM-V 4.5** has an Ollama card and a GGUF release; it’s designed for end-side deployment and supports “fast” vs “deep” thinking modes. Expect to lean on CPU RAM and reduce image sizes on an 8 GB GPU. ([Ollama][2])

* **Reasoning (local) optional**
  **Unsloth** dynamic GGUFs for Qwen3/DeepSeek brin
