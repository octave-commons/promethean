## 🛠️ Task: Create vault-config .obsidian with Kanban and minimal vault setup

Provide a shareable `.obsidian` folder that new contributors can copy to get the
same Kanban board and plugin configuration. Keep the config minimal so it works
across different operating systems.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Include the Kanban plugin as the only required community plugin
- Document how to copy the config into a fresh clone
- Ensure markdown files render correctly on GitHub without extra plugins

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Store config under `vault-config/.obsidian/`
- [ ] Include `config` and `community-plugins.json`
- [ ] Mention the setup command in `vault-config/README.md`
- [ ] Keep plugin list short (kanban only by default)

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Verify `.obsidian/config` enables Kanban view
- [ ] Add usage notes to `docs/vault-config-readme.md`
- [ ] Link this task from the main README onboarding section
