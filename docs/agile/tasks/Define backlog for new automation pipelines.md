## 🛠️ Task: Define backlog for new automation pipelines

### Context
- The "menu of new pipelines" note sketches candidates like `apidiff`, `i18npack`, `licscan`, `perf-bench`, `glossary`, `adr-bot`, and `riskmap`.
- These concepts lack formal task breakdowns, acceptance criteria, or Piper configurations.
- Capturing a backlog clarifies scope and sequencing for future automation work.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Review the pipeline menu note and extract each candidate’s inputs, outputs, and artefact plans.
- [ ] Create individual task stubs or epics for high-priority pipelines with clear acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Prioritise the backlog based on impact, dependencies, and resource requirements.
- [ ] Link tasks to relevant documentation and stakeholders for follow-up.

### Suggested Plan
1. Summarise the existing pipeline menu content into a structured table (pipeline, purpose, inputs, outputs, status).
2. Collaborate with stakeholders to rank pipelines and identify prerequisites.
3. Generate task files or epics within the agile system for top-ranked pipelines.
4. Document outstanding questions or research needed before implementation.
