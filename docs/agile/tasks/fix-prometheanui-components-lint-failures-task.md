# Fix `@promethean/ui-components` lint failures

## Context

- `nx run @promethean/ui-components:lint` currently fails and blocks the lint stage.
- We need the lint target clean so Nx pipelines succeed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `nx run @promethean/ui-components:lint` completes without errors.
- [x] No new lint errors introduced in other packages.
- [x] Document lint root cause and fix in this task note.

## Plan

1. Reproduce the lint failure and capture the errors.
2. Update source files to satisfy the reported lint rules.
3. Re-run the lint command to verify it passes.
4. Prepare code review notes summarizing the fix.

## Notes

- Scope limited to `packages/ui-components` package.
- Avoid modifying shared eslint config unless required by rule.

## Outcome

- Migrated the `UiChatPanel` and `UiFileExplorer` components to use shadow DOM templates instead of mutating host element style properties, satisfying the functional immutability rules.
- Tightened tests to accumulate lint-friendly immutable tuples.
- Added `.nxignore` to exclude the duplicate `packages/kanban-cli` stub so the Nx project graph resolves and allows lint runs.
- Removed redundant eslint-disable directives from `src/tests/ui-components.test.ts`, resolving the last lint warnings.
- `pnpm nx run @promethean/ui-components:lint` now exits cleanly.
