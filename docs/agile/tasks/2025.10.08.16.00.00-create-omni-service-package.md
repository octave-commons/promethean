## Context

This is the first step in assembling the unified @promethean/omni-service host. We need to create the basic package structure with Fastify setup, configuration management, and entrypoint.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Package created with proper package.json and dependencies
- [ ] Fastify app scaffold with basic configuration
- [ ] Entrypoint script that starts the server
- [ ] Environment configuration examples
- [ ] Basic README with setup instructions
- [ ] TypeScript configuration and build scripts

## Technical Details

**Package Structure:**

```
packages/omni-service/
├── src/
│   ├── app.ts          # Fastify app factory
│   ├── config.ts       # Configuration management
│   └── index.ts        # Entrypoint
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── README.md
└── examples/
    └── .env.example
```

**Dependencies:**

- fastify (core web framework)
- @promethean/omni-protocol (when available)
- dotenv (environment config)
- typescript

**Key Features:**

- Configurable port and host
- Environment-based configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Basic health check endpoint

## Acceptance Criteria

- Package builds successfully with `pnpm build`
- Server starts on configurable port
- Health check endpoint responds at `/health`
- Environment variables are loaded correctly
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
