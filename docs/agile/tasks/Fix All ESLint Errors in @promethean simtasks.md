and common patterns that are currently duplicated across packages:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Service initialization patterns repeated in multiple packages\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Common middleware setups duplicated\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Error handling patterns reimplemented\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Configuration loading patterns scattered across services\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Current State\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n-  has basic utilities but lacks service templates\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Each service reimplements common Fastify setup patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- No standardized service bootstrapping process\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Missing common service abstractions and patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Solution\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEnhance  with comprehensive service templates, middleware, and bootstrapping utilities to eliminate duplication and standardize service development.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Implementation Details\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 1: Service Pattern Analysis\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Analyze existing service implementations for common patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Identify repeated middleware configurations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Map common service initialization flows\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Document service configuration patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 2: Service Template Framework\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCreate comprehensive service template system:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Service Builder Pattern\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Service Templates\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 3: Common Middleware Collection\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCreate standardized middleware implementations:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Authentication & Authorization\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Error Handling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Request/Response Logging\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 4: Configuration Management\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCreate standardized configuration loading:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Service Configuration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 5: Service Bootstrap Utilities\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCreate service startup and lifecycle management:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Service Lifecycle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#### Graceful Shutdown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nReceived , starting graceful shutdown...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Files to Add to @promethean/web-utils\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Usage Examples\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Simple API Service\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### MCP Service\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Migration Strategy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 1: Additive Changes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Add new utilities alongside existing ones\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Create migration guide\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 2: Gradual Adoption\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Update one service at a time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Provide examples and documentation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Phase 3: Deprecation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Deprecate old patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Update service templates\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Remove deprecated code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Expected Impact\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Development Speed**: 70% reduction in service setup time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across all services\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Quality**: Built-in best practices and security\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Maintenance**: Centralized service logic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Developer Experience**: Simplified service creation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Success Metrics\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] All new services use enhanced web-utils\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] 100+ lines of duplicate service code eliminated\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Service setup time reduced from hours to minutes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Consistent middleware and configuration patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- [ ] Improved security and reliability across services\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Dependencies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Requires coordination with service maintainers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Need to update service documentation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Should integrate with existing configuration systems\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Must maintain backward
