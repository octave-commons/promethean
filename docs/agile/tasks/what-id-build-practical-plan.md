filename: Hierarchical Vector Embedding Search
description: >-
  Explains two interpretations of hierarchical vector embedding search:
  hierarchical index structures for ANN (e.g., HNSW, IVF/PQ) and hierarchical
  retrieval over content (doc→section→chunk). Provides practical implementation
  guidance for different scale and memory constraints.

Got it, Err. “Hierarchical vector embedding search” usually means one of two (complementary) things. If you’re building a system, decide which you mean before you write code:

1. Hierarchical index structures coarse→fine inside the ANN index

* HNSW: a multi-layer proximity graph; search starts at a sparse top layer and descends to denser layers. Great recall/latency on high-dimensional data, higher memory and slower builds. Tuned by M, efConstruction, efSearch. ([arXiv][1])
* IVF / IVF+PQ: two-level index—route a query to a few coarse clusters (nlist), then scan only those lists; PQ
