# Description

## Requirements/Definition of done

- There is a chat client that uses the LLM worker via ws
- The LLM worker accepts tool calls
- tool call specs are automaticly  generated from openapi  spec available at [v1  openapi.json](https://err-stealth-16-ai-studio-a1vgg.tailbe888a.ts.net/v1/openapi.json)
- The v1 openapi spec has descriptions which are clear enough to clearly communicate to a model what they are for
