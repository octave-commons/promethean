filename: Cephalon Mythic Refactor
description: >-
  A narrative refactor to restructure the smartgpt-bridge project into mythic
  components: Herald for message adapters, Cephalon Core for routing, and Labs
  for experiments. This approach maintains compatibility while enabling rapid
  iteration and alignment checks through Morganna rules.

I hear you. Let’s pull the myth-thread back through the code by making **Cephalon** the bridge again—and give “smartgpt-bridge” a mythic rebirth without losing your hard-won structure.

# A tight, do-able plan (mythic but shippable)

## 1) Rename the right thing, not everything

Treat this as a narrative refactor, not a yak-shave.

* `packages/smartgpt-bridge` → `packages/herald`
  Role: **message herald** adapters & transports between worlds: Discord/Twitch/CLI ↔ Cephalon.
* New: `packages/cephalon-core`
  Role: **interpreter spine** pure routing & orchestration: STT → LLM → TTS; state machine + contracts.
* New: `packages/cepha
