## 📝 Context Summary

Solid. Here’s a tight **Pantheon primer**—diagrams, math, and the minimum you need to start proving this out without violating your “no automatic cloud fallback” rule.

# Architecture at 10,000 ft

**Non-negotiables**: night mode strips cloud creds; runner user has outbound egress blocked; orchestrator refuses agents whose `runtime.origin !== "local"`. The “router” only chooses among **your** specialists, never a cloud model.

# Night flow (example for code work)

Each node is **bounded** max tool calls, timeouts and emits signed artifacts (input, output, logs, diff). No success? It **stops** and leaves a breadcrumb for you to fix by day.

# Why this can work (math you can measure)

## 1) Throughput & stability

Let:

* \lambda = average micro-tasks enqueued per night
* ( M ) agents with service rates \mu_i tasks/hour
* success probability (before review) p_i for agent (i)
* night budget ( T ) hours

**Stability** (don’t overload the night):

Use a simple M/M/c approximation for wait times; keep \rho ~ 0.7–0.8 so test/review contention doesn’t starve the tail. vLLM’s **continuous batching** (PagedAttention) is how you keep \mu_i up even with small local models. ([arX
