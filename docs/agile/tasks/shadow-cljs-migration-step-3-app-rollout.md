## 🛠️ Description

Transition individual front-end applications from TypeScript builds to Shadow-CLJS using the shared component/macro library.

## Description
- **What changed?** After shared components ship, migrate each `packages/frontends/*` project to CLJS entry points with macro-generated HTML.
- **Where is the impact?** Application packages, build scripts, dev servers, asset output directories.
- **Why now?** Enables consistent tooling and template macros across the product surface.
- **Supporting context** Shadow-CLJS migration plan 2025-10-03.

## Goals
- Deliver parity builds for each app using Shadow-CLJS.
- Update package scripts and documentation to reference the new build pipeline.
- Validate dev server compatibility (e.g., Vite proxies).

## Requirements
- [ ] Each migrated app compiles via Shadow-CLJS.
- [ ] Local dev workflow documented and functioning.
- [ ] Legacy TypeScript build scripts retired once parity is confirmed.

## Subtasks
1. Prioritize candidate apps and outline dependencies.
2. Port entry points + configure outputs per app.
3. Update Nx/PNPM tasks for builds and watches.
4. Validate dev server integration.
5. Document migration per app.

Estimate: 8 (split per app as needed)
