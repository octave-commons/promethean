this stuff all just feels... we're still trying to shove AI into workflows that only made sense before AI... we're like 5 years into the AI times, and no operating system as satisfactorily integrated AI into an experience that did not feel like it was just a separate app tacked onto something no one really thought about. We're 5 years in, and there is no clear winners of the AI arms race. In fact, more competitors are coming into play every day. 

Every one offering up basically the same thing, just plugged into a different model.
