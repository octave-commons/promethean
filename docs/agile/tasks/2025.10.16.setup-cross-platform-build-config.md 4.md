## Task Description

Set up comprehensive cross-platform testing and CI/CD pipeline enhancements for the Promethean framework to ensure consistent quality and deployment across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Current State Analysis

The current CI/CD pipeline has basic cross-platform support but lacks comprehensive testing:

- Basic matrix build configuration exists but needs enhancement
- Limited cross-platform testing coverage
- Missing platform-specific test orchestration
- No cross-platform deployment automation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced CI/CD Matrix Configuration

1. Expand GitHub Actions matrix with more comprehensive testing
2. Add platform-specific test configurations
3. Configure cross-platform artifact management
4. Set up conditional deployment strategies

### Phase 2: Cross-Platform Testing Framework

1. Create platform-specific test suites
2. Set up cross-browser testing integration
3. Configure end-to-end testing across platforms
4. Add performance benchmarking across platforms

### Phase 3: Deployment Automation

1. Create platform-specific deployment pipelines
2. Set up multi-architecture container publishing
3. Configure automated release management
4. Add rollback and monitoring capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Matrix Configuration

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    node-version: [18, 20]
    include:
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        browser: chrome
      - os: windows-latest
        browser: edge
      - os: macos-latest
        browser: safari
```

### Cross-Platform Testing

- Unit tests on all platforms
- Integration tests with platform-specific scenarios
- E2E tests with cross-browser validation
- Performance benchmarks and regression testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Cross-platform deployment automation works
- [ ] Performance benchmarks consistent across platforms
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline handles platform-specific failures gracefully

## Dependencies

- Task 3d967fa8 (Cross-platform build configuration foundation) - COMPLETED
- Task 1e7c2a40 (Docker & container support) - COMPLETED

## Notes

This is the third of 4 cross-platform build tasks, focusing specifically on testing and CI/CD pipeline enhancements to ensure quality across all platforms.
