## 📝 Breakdown Assessment

**⚠️ REQUIRES FURTHER BREAKDOWN** - Score: 5 (borderline, needs clarification)

This task involves standardizing health check utilities but lacks detailed implementation scope:

### Missing Information:

- Current health check implementations inventory
- Target standardization approach
- Specific services involved
- Integration requirements

### Required Breakdown:

1. **Inventory existing health check implementations** (2 points)
2. **Design standardized health check interface** (2 points)
3. **Implement standardization across services** (3 points)
4. **Testing and validation** (1 point)

### Current Status:

- Clear objective but missing details ⚠️
- Requires implementation specification
- Needs breakdown into concrete tasks

### Recommendation:

Return to **accepted** column for detailed breakdown and implementation planning.
