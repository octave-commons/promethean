## 📝 Context Summary

love the clarity. let’s codify exactly what you described, agent-agnostic, as a **Kanban-as-FSM** kernel for `process.md`. no special phases, no timeboxing, minimal rules, procedural, board-driven.

# Step 1 — minimal patch for `process.md` (append verbatim)

If that matches your intent, say **“apply Step 1”** and I’ll slot it into `process.md` as an append-only block.  
**Next step after that** still process-first: add the tiny per-column “Entry / Work / Exit” rule stubs so the FSM is runnable—still minimal, still procedural. Then we’ll craft the Codex Cloud prompt to treat this doc as scripture and keep its own 3-phase rhythm init/working/wrap-up **in `codex-cloud.md`, not in the process.**

```
