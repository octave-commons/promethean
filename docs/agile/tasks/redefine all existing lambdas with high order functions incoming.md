## 🛠️ Description

Replace ad‑hoc anonymous lambdas with well‑named higher‑order functions to clarify intent and improve reuse.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Reduce ambiguous inline lambdas throughout the codebase
- Establish reusable helpers that capture shared closure logic

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Each former lambda extracted into a named function or higher‑order wrapper
- [ ] Added tests cover behavior of new helpers

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Audit modules for deeply nested lambdas
- [ ] Refactor candidate lambdas into named functions
- [ ] Create higher‑order utilities where closures are required
- [ ] Update references and run tests
