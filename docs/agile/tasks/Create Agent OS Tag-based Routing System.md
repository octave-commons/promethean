Implement tag-based routing and filtering for Agent OS message distribution\n\n**Scope:**\n- Design tag taxonomy and classification system\n- Implement message routing based on tags and metadata\n- Create tag-based subscription and filtering mechanisms\n- Add dynamic tag management and updates\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Messages are routed based on tag matching rules\n- [ ] Agents can subscribe to specific tag combinations\n- [ ] Tag hierarchy and inheritance works correctly\n- [ ] Dynamic tag updates affect routing in real-time\n- [ ] Tag-based filtering is efficient and scalable\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Efficient tag indexing and lookup\n- Support for complex tag expressions (AND, OR, NOT)\n- Tag versioning and migration support\n- Performance optimization for high-volume routing\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- Implement Agent OS Pipeline Integration\n\n**Labels:** agent-os,tags,routing,filtering,classification,critical
