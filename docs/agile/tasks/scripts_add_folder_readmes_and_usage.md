Scripts: Add READMEs and usage docs per folder

Goal: Ensure each scripts subfolder has a README with purpose, dependencies, environment, and examples.

Scope:

  - scripts/docs/
  - scripts/audio/
  - scripts/indexing/
  - scripts/misc/ (if created)
- Link from scripts/README.md to each subfolder.

Exit Criteria:
- Each folder has a concise README with clear commands and prerequisites.
