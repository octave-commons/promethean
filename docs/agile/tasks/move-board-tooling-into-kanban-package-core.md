Move the TypeScript utilities under `tools/board/` into the maintained `@promethean/kanban` package so they ship with the rest of the board automation CLI.

## Plan
- [x] Inspect the legacy `tools/board/*` entrypoints and data contracts.
- [x] Relocate the scripts into a `packages/kanban/src/board` directory, exporting them as part of the package build.
- [x] Update documentation and any hard-coded paths or references to the old location.
- [x] Ensure `@promethean/kanban` builds cleanly and lint passes on touched files. *(Resolved TypeScript errors in `src/lib/task-complexity.ts` and exported shared helpers for reuse.)*
- [ ] Coordinate with hygiene task `kanban-fsm-update-001` so the relocated tooling honours the FSM status map used by the board automation.

## Definition of Done
- Board utilities live inside `packages/kanban/src/` with updated imports.
- Docs reference the new invocation path (`pnpm tsx packages/kanban/...`).
- Tests and builds for the `@promethean/kanban` package succeed.
