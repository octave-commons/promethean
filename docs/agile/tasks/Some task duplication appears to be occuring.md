# Description

While the majority of task duplication seems to be handled, some tasks still appeared to have duplicates. Most of them had non-uuid uuids, making me think that they were the result of agents creating new tasks, either to push a card through using a bug they found, or because they got frustrated trying to edit the file.

There could also be an issue in epic creation.
Investigation required
