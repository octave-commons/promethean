## 🛠️ Task: Read AGENTS.md and follow protocol

Read the root governance doc (**AGENTS.md**) and immediately align this session to its requirements. Create a traceable task (this file), capture scope/acceptance, and record artifacts per **docs/agile/process.md**.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Confirm coding + working style mandates from **AGENTS.md**.
- Adopt the **Kanban FSM** flow; avoid off-board work.
- Produce evidence of compliance (this task + changelog entry).

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [x] Locate and read `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] Locate and read `docs/agile/process.md`.
- [x] Create a task documenting the compliance action.
- [x] Add a `changelog.d` entry summarizing the action.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- This task exists under `docs/agile/tasks/` with status **done**.
- Changelog contains a dated note referencing this task.
- Next work will be associated to an existing Kanban task or a new one created via template/CLI, not by editing the generated board.

---

## 📋 Notes
- Key mandates captured: functional TS, immutability, TDD, document-driven dev; avoid config edits unless asked; small auditable changes; use eslint + ts-lsp.
- Kanban commands are documented in **AGENTS.md**; we did not run CLI here, only created the source task per process.
