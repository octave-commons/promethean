# Migrate @promethean/kanban to ClojureScript

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Port all TypeScript kanban functionality to ClojureScript
- [ ] Maintain API compatibility with existing CLI commands
- [ ] Add type safety with Typed Clojure
- [ ] Preserve all existing tests and add ClojureScript tests
- [ ] Update build pipeline for ClojureScript compilation
- [ ] Migrate configuration and schema handling
- [ ] Update documentation for ClojureScript usage

## Implementation Details
1. **Architecture Planning**: Design ClojureScript module structure
2. **Core Logic Migration**: Port board operations, task management
3. **CLI Interface**: Maintain command-line compatibility
4. **Type System**: Implement Typed Clojure for type safety
5. **Testing**: Port and create new test suites
6. **Build System**: Setup Shadow-CLJS compilation
7. **Documentation**: Update all documentation

## Dependencies
- Shadow-CLJS build tool setup
- Typed Clojure expertise
- Understanding of existing TypeScript implementation

## Complexity Estimate: 13 (Fibonacci) - MUST BE SPLIT
This task is too large and complex for single implementation.

**Recommended Split:**
- Phase 1: Core data structures and basic operations (5)
- Phase 2: CLI interface and commands (3)  
- Phase 3: Advanced features and integrations (5)

## Exit Criteria
Fully functional ClojureScript kanban package with type safety and complete test coverage.
