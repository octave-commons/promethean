# Task: Design Cross-Platform Compatibility Layer

## 🎯 Objective

Create architecture for bb (Babashka), nbb, JVM Clojure, and shadow-cljs compatibility with platform detection and feature loading.

## 📋 Description

This task involves designing the cross-platform compatibility layer that will allow the agent instruction generator to work seamlessly across all target Clojure platforms. The design must handle platform-specific capabilities, feature detection, and graceful degradation.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Platform detection system design complete
- [ ] Feature loading strategy defined for each platform
- [ ] Cross-platform API specification documented
- [ ] Compatibility matrix created with supported features
- [ ] Architecture diagrams and implementation guidelines produced

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Platform Support Matrix

```clojure
;; Target Platforms:
- bb (Babashka) - Native binary execution
- nbb (Node.js Babashka) - Node.js runtime
- JVM Clojure - Full JVM with all libraries
- shadow-cljs - ClojureScript compilation target
```

### Core Design Components

#### 1. Platform Detection System

- Runtime environment detection
- Capability assessment per platform
- Feature availability checking
- Graceful fallback mechanisms

#### 2. Feature Loading Strategy

- Conditional feature loading based on platform
- Platform-specific implementations
- Shared functionality abstraction
- Error handling for unsupported features

#### 3. Cross-Platform API

- Unified interface across all platforms
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Consistent behavior and error handling
- Performance considerations per platform

### Architecture Requirements

#### Detection Logic

```clojure
(defn detect-platform []
  (cond
    (bb-available?) :babashka
    (nbb-available?) :node-babashka
    (jvm-available?) :jvm
    (cljs-available?) :clojurescript))
```

#### Feature Loading

```clojure
(defn load-platform-features [platform]
  (case platform
    :babashka (load-babashka-features)
    :node-babashka (load-node-features)
    :jvm (load-jvm-features)
    :clojurescript (load-cljs-features)))
```

## 🏗️ Implementation Approach

1. **Platform Analysis**: Research capabilities and limitations of each target platform
2. **Feature Mapping**: Identify which features are available on each platform
3. **API Design**: Create unified API that works across all platforms
4. **Detection Strategy**: Design runtime platform detection mechanism
5. **Compatibility Matrix**: Document supported features per platform
6. **Architecture Documentation**: Create comprehensive design documentation

## 📊 Deliverables

1. **Platform Compatibility Analysis** (`platform-compatibility-analysis.md`)

   - Platform capabilities comparison
   - Feature availability matrix
   - Limitations and constraints

2. **Architecture Design Document** (`cross-platform-architecture.md`)

   - System architecture diagrams
   - Component interactions
   - Data flow specifications

3. **API Specification** (`cross-platform-api-spec.md`)

   - Unified interface definitions
   - Platform-specific implementations
   - Error handling specifications

4. **Implementation Guidelines** (`platform-implementation-guide.md`)
   - Development guidelines per platform
   - Testing strategies
   - Deployment considerations

## 🔗 Dependencies

- None (foundational design task)

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- **Platform Fragmentation**: Mitigate with comprehensive testing and unified API
- **Feature Inconsistency**: Design clear feature detection and fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Variations**: Optimize per platform while maintaining consistency
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Use shared abstractions and minimize platform-specific code

## 📈 Success Metrics

- Complete platform compatibility design
- Clear feature availability documentation
- Actionable implementation guidelines
- Foundation for cross-platform development
