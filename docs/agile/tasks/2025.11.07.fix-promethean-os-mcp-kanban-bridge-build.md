## Summary
- Bridge server has uninitialized class properties, redeclared exports, missing event emitter APIs on SyncEngine/MetricsCollector, and improper ioredis typings.
- Impact: `pnpm build` remains red for @promethean-os/mcp-kanban-bridge.

## Failure Evidence
- TS2564 for syncEngine/webhookServer/...
- TS2339: Property 'on' does not exist on type 'SyncEngine'
- TS2709: Cannot use namespace 'Redis' as a type

## Required Actions
1. Add constructor initializers and proper interfaces for sync/metrics components
2. Switch to default export from ioredis typings
3. Rebuild

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build command `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/mcp-kanban-bridge build` completes without errors
- Root `pnpm build` no longer reports this package as failing
- Tests or smoke checks relevant to @promethean-os/mcp-kanban-bridge pass
