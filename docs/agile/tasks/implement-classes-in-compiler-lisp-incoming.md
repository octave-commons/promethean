# 🛠️ Task: Implement Classes in Lisp Compiler

## 📖 Description
Introduce a `defclass` macro to the Promethean Lisp compiler that supports class definitions with fields and methods. This will enable object-oriented abstractions on top of functional Lisp foundations.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Provide a `defclass` syntax for defining classes.
- Support field declarations with default values.
- Support method definitions bound to the class.
- Enable class instantiation and method dispatch.
- Integrate with existing `defun` and `lambda` infrastructure.

---

## 📦 Requirements / Definition of Done
- [ ] Parser recognizes `(defclass <name> (<fields>) (<methods>))`.
- [ ] AST extended with `ClassNode` and `MethodNode`.
- [ ] Environment extended to bind classes as first-class entities.
- [ ] Instances can be created via `make-instance <Class>`.
- [ ] Methods can be invoked on instances `(call <instance> <method> <args>...)`.
- [ ] Support single inheritance (optional for v1).
- [ ] Unit tests cover creation, field access, method invocation.
- [ ] Docs updated with `defclass` usage examples.

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [ ] Update parser to handle `defclass` syntax.
- [ ] Extend AST with `ClassNode` and `MethodNode`.
- [ ] Extend evaluator to create and bind class objects.
- [ ] Implement instance creation `make-instance`.
- [ ] Implement method dispatch (`call`).
- [ ] Add tests for field defaults, method binding, and inheritance.
- [ ] Document class usage in Lisp compiler reference.

---

## 🔗 Dependencies
- Blocked by: `implement defun in compiler lisp incoming` (functions must exist before methods).
- Builds toward: `lisp ecosystem files`, `lisp package files`.

---

## 📚 Relevant Resources
- Common Lisp HyperSpec: [`defclass`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_defcla.htm)
- CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) overview
- Hy `defclass` equivalents via macros
