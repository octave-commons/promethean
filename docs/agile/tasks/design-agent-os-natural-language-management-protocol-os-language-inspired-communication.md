## 🚨 DECOMPOSED TASK\n\nThis complex task has been broken down into focused sub-tasks:\n\n### Sub-tasks Created:\n1. **Design Agent OS Core Message Protocol** (0c3189e4) - P0\n2. **Implement Natural Language Command Parser** (52c48585) - P0\n3. **Create Agent OS Context Management System** (1544d523) - P0\n4. **Implement Agent OS Pipeline Integration** (7528d106) - P1\n5. **Create Agent OS Tag-based Routing System** (2532c891) - P1\n6. **Develop Agent OS Protocol Testing & Validation Suite** (9475b327) - P1\n\n### Original Scope:\nThe Agent OS Natural Language Management Protocol covered message protocol design, NLP parsing, context management, pipeline integration, tag-based routing, and testing.\n\n### Current Status:\n✅ **Decomposed** - Work should proceed with the focused sub-tasks above\n- Each sub-task has clear acceptance criteria and technical requirements\n- Dependencies follow logical implementation sequence\n- Priority levels reflect criticality and workflow dependencies\n\n### Next Actions:\n- Work on sub-tasks in dependency order (Core Protocol → Parser/Context → Integration → Routing → Testing)\n- Use this task as tracking/coordination only\n- Close when all sub-tasks are complete
