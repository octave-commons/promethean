## Overview\n\nImplement a comprehensive health monitoring and alerting framework for the kanban system to proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact workflow efficiency.\n\n## Current Issues Identified\n\nBased on recent analysis, the kanban system has several areas needing attention:\n\n1. **Task Quality Issues**: Multiple empty-content tasks, missing estimates, poor scoping\n2. **Flow Bottlenecks**: Incoming backlog (289 tasks), underutilized capacity in some columns\n3. **WIP Limit Violations**: Historical issues with blocked column capacity\n4. **Duplicate Tasks**: Multiple similar tasks creating noise\n5. **Process Compliance**: Need for better enforcement of task creation standards\n\n## Core Components Needed\n\n### 1. Health Monitoring Dashboard\n- Real-time board health metrics\n- Column capacity utilization tracking\n- Task aging analysis\n- Flow velocity measurements\n- WIP limit violation alerts\n\n### 2. Automated Quality Checks\n- Task content validation\n- Duplicate detection\n- Estimate completeness verification\n- Scoping adequacy assessment\n\n### 3. Alerting System\n- Threshold-based notifications\n- Bottleneck detection\n- Aging task alerts\n- Process violation warnings\n\n### 4. Healing Automation\n- Automatic task triage suggestions\n- Duplicate task consolidation\n- WIP limit optimization recommendations\n- Workflow bottleneck resolution\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Reduce empty-content tasks by 90%\n- Maintain WIP limit compliance at 95%+\n- Improve task flow velocity by 50%\n- Reduce manual board grooming time by 80%\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- MCP tools for real-time monitoring\n- Kanban CLI for automated healing operations\n- Agent workflows for proactive maintenance\n- Documentation system for process compliance
