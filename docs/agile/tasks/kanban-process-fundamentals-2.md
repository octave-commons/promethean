filename: Kanban Process Fundamentals

  This document explains the core principles of a Kanban process as a finite
  state machine with defined transitions and blocking conditions. It emphasizes
  how minor and major blocking conditions trigger interventions without
  requiring a fixed schedule or timer. The process ensures tasks move only when
  necessary, with minimal human intervention.
tags:
  - kanban
  - finite state machine
  - blocking conditions
  - process flow
  - minor blocking
  - major blocking
  - intervention rules

I'm saying there isn't a ready to code gate at all. Because the it's all just process.

You're being far too literal about all of this.

I shouldn't have to say anything about the giant inputs.

If I have to dictate all of that, the process is too complex to follow.

The process are the columns on the board.

The phases aren't a part of core process document. That is specific to codex cloud.

The process is a finite state machine.
There is a set of possible states an given task t can be in C
Each state Cn has a set of transitions T a task t can make to other members of C
There is a starting state S
