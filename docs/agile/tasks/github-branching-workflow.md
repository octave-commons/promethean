## 📝 Context Summary

# Github Branching Workflow

- **Branches:**
  - `chore/<task>`, `codex/<task>` go to `main`.

- **Development Setup:**
  - Use multiple computers (`stealth` and `yoga`) for development.
  - Changes flow from `dev/<hostname>` to `testing`, then `staging`, and finally
    `main`.

- **Typical Workflow:**
  1. `codex/<task>` -> `dev/codex-staging` -> `main`
  2. `feat/codex-<task>` indicates a human operator has taken over a Codex task.
  3. `<type>/<task>` branches for specific tasks.

- **Branching Rules:**
  - Prefixed with `codex/` indicate Codex responsibility.
  - Others are my responsibility unless default merging causes issues.

- **Obsidian Workflow:**
  1. `obsidian/<hostname>` -> `obsidian/staging` -> `obsidian/main` -> `docs/staging` -> `docs/staging`
  2. Ideal flow: `<describer>/<task>` -> `obsidian/testing` -> `dev/staging` ->
     `main`

- **Documentation Flow:**
  1. `<codex|docs|readme|etc>/<task>` -> `obsidian/<hostname>` ->

  2. Staging branch uses GitHub Actions for transformations.

## Diagrams

We have a kind of process at the moment.
We will capture the current flow we do implicitly
so we can begin to do it explicitly
And describe a step by step process that
