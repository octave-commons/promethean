# Description

Makefile.hy is kind of a disaster. We should move away from it, pull out all of it's existing behavior into ./dev/tools.py

## Requirements/Definition of done

- All documentation is updated to reflect new build, test, formatting, and so on procedures
- Make file is no more
- All behavior previously excuted by Makefile and Makefil.hy are now modularized and accessable from `./dev/tools.hy`
