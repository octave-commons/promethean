## 🛠️ Description

- Provide an MCP server that can install, add, and remove pnpm dependencies at the workspace root or scoped to a package filter, plus expose pnpm script execution.

## Description
- **What changed?** New requirement to automate pnpm dependency and script operations via MCP so agents can manage workspace packages.
- **Where is the impact?** Applies to dev tooling; new server likely lives under `packages/` and touches workspace config.
- **Why now?** Enables remote automation and scripted dependency updates for MCP clients.
- **Supporting context** User request in current session.

## Goals
- MCP server exposes tools for `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm remove`, and script execution with optional `--filter` package targeting.
- Document usage and constraints so future agents can extend capabilities safely.

## Requirements
- [ ] pnpm operations succeed for workspace root and filtered packages.
- [ ] Tests or smoke checks cover command invocation helpers.
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage details.
- [ ] PR merged: (link once created)
- [ ] Additional constraints or non-functional requirements are addressed: support GPL-3.0-only licensing and follow repo lint/build gates.

## Subtasks
1. Review existing MCP tooling packages and decide placement for new server.
2. Implement pnpm command runner with workspace vs filter support.
3. Register MCP tools/resources and provide docs/tests.

Estimate: 5
