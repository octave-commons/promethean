## Overview

Implement comprehensive agent status monitoring that provides real-time visibility into agent health, performance, and task progress. This system will integrate with the kanban board and provide alerts for agent issues.

## Description

Create an agent monitoring system that:
- Tracks agent health and responsiveness
- Monitors task progress and performance metrics
- Provides real-time status updates on the kanban board
- Sends alerts for agent issues or failures
- Maintains historical agent performance data
- Integrates with existing heartbeat and monitoring systems

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Real-time agent health monitoring implemented
- [ ] Agent performance metrics collection and reporting
- [ ] Integration with kanban board for status display
- [ ] Alert system for agent issues and failures
- [ ] Historical data tracking and analysis
- [ ] Dashboard/CLI interface for monitoring data
- [ ] Integration with existing heartbeat system
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for monitoring scenarios
- [ ] Documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Subtasks

### 1. Health Monitoring Infrastructure

- [ ] Create agent status tracking database/cache
- [ ] Build monitoring data collection pipeline
- [ ] Implement agent heartbeat processing

### 2. Performance Metrics
- [ ] Define and collect agent performance metrics
- [ ] Create task progress tracking system
- [ ] Implement resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Build performance trend analysis

### 3. Alert System
- [ ] Create alert rules and thresholds
- [ ] Implement notification system for alerts
- [ ] Build alert escalation logic
- [ ] Create alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking

### 4. Integration & Display
- [ ] Integrate monitoring with kanban board
- [ ] Create CLI interface for monitoring data
- [ ] Build monitoring dashboard (optional)
- [ ] Implement historical data visualization

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- `@promethean/kanban` - existing kanban system
- `@promethean/heartbeat` - agent health monitoring
- `@promethean/level-cache` - monitoring data storage
- `@promethean/omni-service` - notification system

### Integration Points
- Extend `packages/kanban/src/lib/` with monitoring functionality
- Integrate with existing heartbeat system
- Use kanban event system for status updates
- Coordinate with agent management commands

### API Design
```bash
# Monitoring commands
pnpm kanban monitor agents
pnpm kanban monitor agent <agent-id>
pnpm kanban monitor health
pnpm kanban monitor alerts

# Historical data
pnpm kanban monitor history <agent-id> --days 7
pnpm kanban monitor trends --metric performance

# Alert management
pnpm kanban alerts list
pnpm kanban alerts acknowledge <alert-id>
pnpm kanban alerts resolve <alert-id>
```
