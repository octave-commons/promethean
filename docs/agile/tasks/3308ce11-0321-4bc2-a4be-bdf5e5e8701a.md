# Kanban System Health Monitoring & Alerting Framework

## Code Review Status: A- Grade (Configuration Complete, Monitoring Logic Partial)

## Updated Implementation Details

**✅ COMPLETED COMPONENTS:**

- Configuration system for health monitoring
- Basic metrics collection infrastructure
- MCP integration framework
- Alert configuration templates

**🔄 REMAINING WORK:**

- Monitoring logic implementation
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Dashboard integration
- Automated healing actions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement monitoring logic for WIP limit violations
- [ ] Add real-time stuck task detection (time in column > threshold)
- [ ] Create alerting system for board flow anomalies
- [ ] Build task aging and priority drift tracking
- [ ] Generate automated daily/weekly health reports
- [ ] Complete MCP integration for automated healing
- [ ] Develop real-time monitoring dashboard

## Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Monitoring Logic Implementation (1 session)

- Complete WIP violation monitoring logic
- Implement stuck task detection algorithms
- Add task aging calculations
- Create priority drift detection

### Phase 2: Alerting & Reporting (1 session)

- Build configurable alerting system
- Implement automated report generation
- Add trend analysis capabilities
- Create dashboard integration

## Dependencies

- ✅ Existing kanban board data structure
- ✅ MCP integration framework (complete)
- ✅ Configuration system (complete)
- ⚠️ Alerting infrastructure (partial)

## Updated Complexity Estimate: 3 (Fibonacci) - Ready for Implementation

**Note**: Reduced from complexity 8 due to completed configuration and infrastructure components. Remaining work is focused on monitoring logic and alerting implementation.

## Exit Criteria

System automatically detects and alerts on kanban flow issues with integration to healing agents.
