## 📝 Breakdown Assessment

**🚨 EPIC - REQUIRES BREAKDOWN** - Score: 13 (massive program oversight)

This migration program oversight is too broad for single implementation and requires decomposition into focused management tracks:

### Program Scope:

- Infrastructure setup coordination
- 50+ package migration oversight
- Testing validation framework management
- Workflow transition coordination
- Quality assurance and validation
- Team training and documentation

### Required Management Tracks:

1. **Infrastructure Setup Coordination** (3 points) - Typed ClojureScript infrastructure
2. **Core Package Migration Management** (5 points) - Critical packages first
3. **Testing Framework Oversight** (3 points) - Migration validation system
4. **Workflow Transition Management** (3 points) - Process and tool migration
5. **Quality Assurance Program** (3 points) - Validation and compliance
6. **Team Training & Documentation** (2 points) - Knowledge transfer

### Current Status:

- Program scope defined ✅
- Migration targets identified ✅
- Oversight responsibilities clear ✅
- Too large for single management ⚠️
- Needs breakdown into focused tracks

### Recommendation:

Return to **accepted** column for breakdown into focused program management tracks.
