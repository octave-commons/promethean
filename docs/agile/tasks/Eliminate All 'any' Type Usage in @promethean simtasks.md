## 🎯 Task Overview\n\nReplace all 18 instances of unsafe 'any' assignments with proper TypeScript types throughout the @promethean/simtasks codebase.\n\n## 📋 Description\n\nThis task addresses the critical type safety issues identified in the code review. Currently there are 18 instances of 'any' usage throughout the codebase that need to be replaced with proper TypeScript types to improve type safety and maintainability.\n\n## 🔍 Scope\n\n**Files to be updated:**\n- Core processing modules: 01-scan.ts, 02-embed.ts, 03-cluster.ts, 04-plan.ts, 05-write.ts\n- Supporting files: types.ts, utils.ts\n\n## 📝 Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All 18 instances of 'any' usage identified and replaced\n- [ ] Proper TypeScript interfaces defined for complex data structures\n- [ ] Type safety maintained without breaking existing functionality\n- [ ] All type assertions are safe and justified\n- [ ] TypeScript compiler reports no 'any' usage warnings\n- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass\n\n## 🎯 Story Points: 13\n\n**Breakdown:**\n- Audit and catalog all 'any' usage instances: 2 points\n- Define proper TypeScript interfaces for data structures: 4 points\n- Replace 'any' types in core processing modules: 5 points\n- Replace 'any' types in supporting files: 2 points\n\n## 🚧 Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Audit Phase:** Create comprehensive list of all 'any' types with context and replacement strategy\n2. **Interface Design:** Create interfaces for complex objects currently using 'any' types\n3. **Core Module Updates:** Update 01-scan.ts through 05-write.ts with proper typing\n4. **Supporting Files:** Update types.ts and utils.ts with proper typing\n\n## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations\n\n- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality\n- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and gradual refactoring\n- **Risk:** Complex type definitions\n- **Mitigation:** Start with simple types, progressively refine\n\n## 📚 Dependencies\n\n- Must be completed before other type safety improvements\n- Prerequisite for comprehensive testing implementation
