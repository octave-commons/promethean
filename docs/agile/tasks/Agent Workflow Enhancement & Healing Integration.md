## Overview\n\nEnhance agent workflows to integrate kanban healing capabilities, enabling proactive maintenance, automated issue resolution, and intelligent task management.\n\n## Current Agent Workflow Limitations\n\nBased on agent system analysis and kanban integration review:\n\n1. **Reactive vs Proactive**: Agents primarily react to issues rather than preventing them\n2. **Manual Healing**: Most kanban healing requires manual intervention\n3. **Limited Context**: Agents lack comprehensive board health context\n4. **Siloed Operations**: Healing operations not integrated into normal workflows\n5. **Knowledge Gaps**: Agents lack specialized healing expertise\n\n## Agent Enhancement Framework\n\n### 1. Proactive Monitoring Agents\n- **Health Watchers**: Continuous board health monitoring\n- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and potential issues\n- **Predictive Alerts**: Anticipate problems before they occur\n- **Automated Triage**: Classify and prioritize issues automatically\n\n### 2. Healing Specialist Agents\n- **Quality Validators**: Automated task quality assessment and improvement\n- **Flow Optimizers**: Workflow bottleneck identification and resolution\n- **Migration Handlers**: Automated migration execution and validation\n- **Security Guardians**: MCP security monitoring and enforcement\n\n### 3. Coordination Agents\n- **Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple healing operations\n- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle competing healing priorities\n- **Resource Management**: Optimize agent allocation for healing tasks\n- **Communication**: Liaise between agents and human operators\n\n### 4. Learning & Adaptation\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from successful healing operations\n- **Adaptive Strategies**: Improve healing approaches over time\n- **Knowledge Base**: Build comprehensive healing expertise\n- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor and optimize agent effectiveness\n\n## Implementation Components\n\n### 1. Agent Role Definitions\n\n\n### 2. Workflow Integration\n- Healing triggers in normal agent workflows\n- Context-aware healing recommendations\n- Automated healing operation execution\n- Human-in-the-loop validation for critical changes\n\n### 3. Communication Protocols\n- Standardized healing request/response formats\n- Progress reporting and status updates\n- Escalation procedures for complex issues\n- Documentation of healing operations\n\n### 4. Performance Monitoring\n- Healing operation success rates\n- Agent efficiency metrics\n- System health improvement tracking\n- User satisfaction measurements\n\n## Key Agent Capabilities\n\n### 1. Automated Healing Operations\n- Task content enhancement\n- Duplicate consolidation\n- Workflow optimization\n- Security vulnerability resolution\n\n### 2. Intelligent Decision Making\n- Context-aware prioritization\n- Risk assessment for healing operations\n- Resource allocation optimization\n- Impact analysis and mitigation\n\n### 3. Collaborative Healing\n- Multi-agent coordination\n- Human-agent collaboration\n- Knowledge sharing and learning\n- Continuous improvement\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Proactive Resolution**: 80% of issues resolved before human detection\n- **Healing Success Rate**: 95% automated healing success rate\n- **Agent Efficiency**: 50% reduction in manual healing effort\n- **System Health**: 90% reduction in critical board health issues\n- **Knowledge Growth**: Continuous improvement in healing capabilities\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Proactive monitoring agents implemented\n- [ ] Healing specialist agents deployed\n- [ ] Coordination agents operational\n- [ ] Learning and adaptation systems functional\n- [ ] Workflow integration complete\n- [ ] Communication protocols established\n- [ ] Performance monitoring deployed\n- [ ] Documentation and training materials\n\n## Blocking Dependencies\n\n- Kanban System Health Monitoring (for monitoring data)\n- Task Quality & Content Validation (for quality healing)\n- MCP-Kanban Integration Healing (for security healing)\n\n## Blocks\n\n- Agent System Optimization (enhanced by healing integration)\n- Human-Agent Collaboration (improved through healing workflows)
