# Fix docops pipeline file reference issue

## 📋 Issue Description

The docops pipeline has a file reference issue: Missing input documentation files. This prevents pipeline execution and needs immediate resolution.

## 🔍 Technical Details

- **Pipeline**: docops
- **Issue**: Missing input documentation files
- **Detection**: Automated pipeline fix generator


## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identify the incorrect file reference in docops pipeline
- [ ] Update pipeline configuration to reference correct file path
- [ ] Add case-insensitive file lookup for robustness
- [ ] Test pipeline execution to ensure file resolution works

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation (30 minutes)
- [ ] Locate the problematic file reference or dependency
- [ ] Analyze current pipeline configuration
- [ ] Identify root cause and impact scope

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Implement the actual fix based on issue type
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Update related documentation if needed

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)
- [ ] Run pipeline in dry-run mode to verify configuration
- [ ] Execute pipeline and check for successful completion
- [ ] Validate that the original issue is resolved
