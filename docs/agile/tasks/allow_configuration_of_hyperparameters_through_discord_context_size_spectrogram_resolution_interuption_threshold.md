## 🛠️ Description

Expose Discord commands that let users tune audio processing hyperparameters—context
size, spectrogram resolution, and interruption thresholds—without redeploying the
service.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Allow real‑time configuration of audio processing parameters via Discord.
- Improve interruption handling by using audio‑based thresholds that pause output
  when user speech exceeds configurable energy levels.
- Detect interruptions within **200 ms** and correctly classify user speech with
```
**≥95 % accuracy** against background noise.
```
- Allow authorized Discord users to configure model and audio pipeline hyperparameters on the fly.
- Persist chosen values so they survive service restarts.
- Provide clear feedback and validation when values are queried or updated.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Provide `/config audio` commands for `context_size`, `spectrogram_res`, and
```
`interruption_threshold` values.
```
- [ ] Implement adjustable voice‑activity detection that pauses TTS once the
      energy threshold is crossed.
- [ ] Log every interruption event with timestamps and configured parameters.
- [ ] Meet **≤200 ms** interruption latency and **≥95 %** detection accuracy in
      controlled tests.
| Hyperparameter           | Allowed Range                        | Validation Rules |
```
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
```
| `context_size`          | `256`–`32768` tokens                 | Integer within range; reject unsupported values for active model |
| `spectrogram_resolution`| `64`–`4096` bins per dimension, even | Input as `WIDTHxHEIGHT`; both integers, multiples of `2`, and in range |
| `interruption_threshold`| `0.1`–`5.0` seconds                  | Float; clamp to range; round to two decimals |

### Discord Interface

- Slash command: `/config get <param>` to view current value.
- Slash command: `/config set <param> <value>` to update a value.
- Autocomplete or choices should limit input to valid ranges where possible.

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- Restrict `/config` commands to Discord roles flagged as administrators.
- Log every change with user ID and timestamp for auditing.
- Reject values containing code, markup, or unexpectedly long strings to prevent injection or abuse.
- Avoid exposing model secrets or internal topology when responding to unauthenticated queries.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Valid commands update in-memory settings and persist to the service's configuration store.
- [ ] Invalid ranges produce informative error messages without modifying existing values.
- [ ] A `get` command reflects the latest stored value.
- [ ] Security logging shows who changed what and when.

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Add Discord command handlers exposing `context_size`, `spectrogram_res`, and
```
`interruption_threshold` options.
```
- [ ] Integrate a VAD module using the configurable energy threshold.
- [ ] Write tests measuring latency and accuracy of interruption detection.
- [ ] Deploy changes to staging and collect metric samples.
- [ ] Document tuning guidelines for operators.
- [ ] Implement `/config get` and `/config set` Discord commands.
- [ ] Add range validation utilities for each hyperparameter.
- [ ] Persist updates to database or environment file.
- [ ] Gate command usage behind role/permission checks and add audit logging.
- [ ] Add unit tests for validation logic and command handlers.
