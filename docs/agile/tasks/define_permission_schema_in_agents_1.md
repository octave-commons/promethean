## 🛠️ Task: Define permission schema in AGENTS.md

Create a concise section in the root `AGENTS.md` explaining how agents declare
allowed actions and resource access. The schema will be consumed by the future
"permission gating" middleware to enforce boundaries.
allowed actions and resource access. The schema should be simple enough for
manual editing but structured so a parser can enforce permissions during agent
execution.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Specify a human-readable schema for permission rules
- Ensure the schema can be parsed by the permission gating layer
- Provide examples for different agent roles

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Outline required fields (action, scope, default behavior)
- [ ] Document YAML and JSON examples
- [ ] Provide one sample per agent in `agents/*/config/permissions.yaml`
- [ ] Provide at least one example for a read-only agent and one for a full-access agent
- [ ] Link to any mathematical reasoning notes

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Root `AGENTS.md` contains a permission schema section.
- YAML and JSON examples illustrate read-only and full-access agents.
- Sample config files for both roles exist under `agents/*/config/`.

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Draft schema description inside `AGENTS.md`
- [ ] Add example snippet under `agents/duck/config/`
- [ ] Review with team for completeness
- [ ] Update any affected tasks
- [ ] Mirror the schema in `bridge/protocols/permission-schema.md` for future API use
