## 🛠️ Description


It was gettting too chaotic merging everything into main.

I've been loosely working based off dev -> staging -> main
But I need to make clear guidelines for when to merge into each.

Cause our test suite/ci are not reliable enough yet.

Our gold standard for main is  "It worked"

Our standard for staging is "It should work"

And dev was "I'm working on it."
