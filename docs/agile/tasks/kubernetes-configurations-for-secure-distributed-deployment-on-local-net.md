## Task: Kubernetes Configurations for Secure Distributed Deployment on Local Net

### Context
#### Changes and Updates
- **What changed?**: Updated requirements to include secure distributed deployment on local networks, incorporating best practices from recent security audits.
- **Where?**: This task is relevant to the [Kubernetes Project](link) and will be implemented within our internal development environment.

#### Inputs / Artifacts
- ([link] to updated Kubernetes documentation)

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] test 5 out of 10 pod configurations pass: Successfully tested secure distributed deployment on local networks using Kubernetes.
- [ ] doc 1 security policy document updated: Incorporated new security measures into our Kubernetes configuration guide.
- [ ] PR merged: ([link to PR] with a brief summary of changes)

#### Plan
1. Research best practices for secure distributed deployment on local networks (2 hours)
   - Review recent security audits and guidelines from reputable sources, such as OWASP and NIST.

2. Update existing Kubernetes configuration files to incorporate new security measures (4 hours)
   - Implement role-based access control, network policies, and service mesh configurations.
   - Ensure all services are properly secured with SSL/TLS certificates.

3. Test secure distributed deployment on local networks using Kubernetes (2 hours)
   - Verify that pod configurations meet updated security requirements.
   - Identify and resolve any issues or conflicts during testing.

4. Document new security measures in the Kubernetes configuration guide (1 hour)
   - Create a new section in our documentation outlining best practices for secure distributed deployment on local networks.
