description: >-
  A multi-LLM routing system that classifies prompts and routes them to the most
  appropriate downstream model based on complexity, domain, tone, urgency, and
  other factors. This design emphasizes balancing quality, cost, latency,
  scalability, and robustness while incorporating feedback loops for continuous
  improvement.

What you’re describing is a **multi-LLM routing** system (sometimes also called a prompt router) — you intake a prompt, classify/score it, and send it to the “best” downstream model (or chain) depending on complexity, domain, tone, urgency, etc. There’s a fair bit of recent literature and applied engineering on this. E.g. “Doing More with Less: Implementing Routing Strategies in LLM-based Systems” ([arXiv][1]), “MixLLM: Dynamic Routing in Mixed Large Language Models” ([arXiv][2]), “Building an LLM Router for High-Quality and Cost-Effective Responses” ([Anyscale
