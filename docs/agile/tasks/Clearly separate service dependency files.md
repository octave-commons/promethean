## 🛠️ Task: Clearly separate service dependency files


---

## 🎯 Goals

- Each service should declare its own Python and Node dependencies
(`requirements.txt` or `package.json`).
- Reduce cross‑service coupling in the root manifests.
- Document how to install dependencies for an individual service.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Audit existing packages in the root manifests.
- [ ] Move service‑specific libraries into the corresponding service folder.
- [ ] Keep shared dev tooling (lint, test runners) at the repository root.
- [ ] Update documentation to describe per‑service setup.

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] List all current dependencies by service.
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` or `package.json` as needed.
- [ ] Update the Makefile to install dependencies per service.
- [ ] Clean up obsolete references in the root manifests.
