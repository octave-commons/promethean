The MCP server configuration file at [[packages/mcp/config/mcp_servers.edn]] had a syntax error preventing startup:

## Issue:
- EDN parsing error: 'Map accepts an array with an even number of items. You provided 15 items'
- The :mcp-servers map structure was malformed

## Root Cause:
The original EDN file had structural issues in the map definitions that caused the jsedn parser to fail.

## Solution Applied:
- Fixed EDN syntax by properly structuring the :mcp-servers map
- Restored complete configuration with all tools (48+ tools across 8 endpoints)
- Server now starts successfully on http://0.0.0.0:3210
- All HTTP endpoints are functional

## Relevant Files:
- [[packages/mcp/config/mcp_servers.edn]] - Main MCP configuration
- [[packages/mcp/src/index.ts]] - MCP server startup logic
- [[packages/mcp/src/proxy/config.ts]] - Configuration loading logic

Priority: P1 - MCP server is critical for development workflow
