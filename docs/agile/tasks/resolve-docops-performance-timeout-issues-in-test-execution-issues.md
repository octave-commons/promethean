## 🛠️ Description

DocOps package tests are timing out after 2 minutes during documentation processing, likely due to large file operations, infinite loops, or inefficient markdown processing algorithms.

**What changed?** DocOps test execution times have exceeded acceptable limits, causing CI/CD failures and blocking documentation system development.

**Where is the impact?** DocOps package affecting documentation generation, markdown processing, and dev-ui functionality.

**Why now?** Documentation system reliability is critical for project documentation and developer onboarding.

**Supporting context**: DocOps has complex file processing pipelines (661 lines dev-ui.ts) that may be encountering performance bottlenecks with large documentation sets.

## Goals

- Resolve DocOps test timeout issues and improve performance
- Optimize documentation processing algorithms for large file sets
- Ensure reliable documentation generation and processing
- Implement performance monitoring for documentation workflows

## Requirements

- [ ] All DocOps tests complete within timeout limits (under 2 minutes)
- [ ] Documentation processing handles large file sets efficiently
- [ ] Markdown processing algorithms are optimized for performance
- [ ] Dev-ui responsiveness maintained during documentation processing

## Subtasks

1. Profile DocOps test execution to identify performance bottlenecks
2. Investigate markdown processing algorithms for optimization opportunities
3. Optimize file system operations and database interactions
4. Implement streaming or chunked processing for large documentation sets
5. Add performance monitoring and timeout handling
6. Optimize database queries and indexing for documentation metadata
7. Test with various documentation sizes to ensure scalability
8. Add performance regression tests to prevent future slowdowns

Estimate: 8
