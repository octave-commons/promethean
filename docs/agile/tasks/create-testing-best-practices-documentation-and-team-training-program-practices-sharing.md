## 🛠️ Description

Testing approaches vary across packages with no consistent standards or documented best practices. Need comprehensive documentation and training to ensure high-quality testing across the team.

**What changed?** Testing improvements need consistent standards and team knowledge sharing to be effective long-term.

**Where is the impact?** All developers and packages - need consistent testing standards and knowledge.

**Why now?** Testing infrastructure improvements require team adoption and consistent practices to be effective.

**Supporting context**: Repository has sophisticated testing infrastructure but lacks documented standards and team training materials.

## Goals
