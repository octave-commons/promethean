## 📝 Context Summary

I'm saying there isn't a ready to code gate at all. Because the it's all just process.

You're being far too literal about all of this.

I shouldn't have to say anything about the giant inputs.

If I have to dictate all of that, the process is too complex to follow.

The process are the columns on the board.

The phases aren't a part of core process document. That is specific to codex cloud.

The process is a finite state machine.
There is a set of possible states an given task t can be in C
Each state Cn has a set of transitions T a task t can make to other members of C
There is a starting state S
There are transition rules R(Tn, t) that can't ever evaluate to true during the same turn, each transition is a unique rule, and either they are all false, or 1 is true.

When 1 is true, the task t make the T from it's current state, to the transition's target state.

if multiple transitions appear to be valid, if it was just a bunch of humans, it triggers a conversation, an email, a short meeting.
Starting with the smallest possible intervention, gradually escalating until the conflict is resolved.

What makes a kanban powerful is the way the rules naturally create moments of interventi
