**Ticket: Add Tool Chain Management to System**  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Open  
**Assignee**: [Your Team/Developer]  

---

### **Description**  
Implement a centralized tool chain management system to organize, version, and maintain the collection of tools used in development, testing, and deployment workflows. This includes managing dependencies, CI/CD integrations, and ensuring compatibility across environments.  

---

### **Steps**  
1. **Inventory Existing Tools**: Document all current tools (e.g., CI/CD platforms, code analyzers like SonarQube, dependency managers).  
2. **Version Control**: Use a tool chain management platform (e.g., Spinnaker, DevOps as Code) to version and track tool configurations.  
3. **Automate Dependency Updates**: Integrate dependency management (e.g., Dependabot, Renovate) to auto-update tools and libraries.  
4. **Centralize Configuration**: Store tool configurations in a shared repository (e.g., Git) for consistency across environments.  
5. **Audit and Compliance**: Regularly audit tool versions and ensure compliance with security policies.

**Notes**:  
- Ensure tool chain management aligns with existing DevOps workflows.  
- Prioritize tools critical to security, compliance, and CI/CD efficiency.
