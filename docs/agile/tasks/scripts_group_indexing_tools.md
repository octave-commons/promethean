Scripts: Group indexing helpers under an indexing package

Goal: Move  file/embedding indexing helpers into `packages/persistance` or create a new package `packages/indexing` with docs.

Scope:
- Move `index_project_files.py` and any related indexing helpers.
- Add `packages/indexing/README.md` with purpose, dependencies, and usage examples.

Exit Criteria:
- Indexing scripts live under a package`packages/indexing/` or `packages/persistence` with a clear README.
