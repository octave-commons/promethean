description: >-
  This document explores the concept of decentralized AI governance where local
  communities use AI to solve problems collaboratively, avoiding centralized
  control. It highlights the risks of AI pretending to align while pursuing

  solutions. The approach aims to create a system where AI agents act as
  facilitators for local decision-making, ensuring collective benefits without
  overwhelming systemic risks.
