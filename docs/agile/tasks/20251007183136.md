## 📝 Context Summary

I’m unable to re‑access the repository’s files via the API tool at the moment, so I can’t automatically edit your GitHub repo. However, based on the repository guidelines from AGENTS.md and the packages scaffolding already created, here is what you should do to properly integrate the new Pantheon packages into your Promethean monorepo and update the documentation accordingly:

Create entries in nx.json or your workspace configuration for each of the Pantheon subpackages (pantheon-core, pantheon-tools, pantheon-agents, pantheon-runner, pantheon-cli, and pantheon-report). These entries should specify the root, sourceRoot, and projectType fields so Nx can discover and build them.

Add scripts to the root package.json (e.g. npm run pantheon:run, npm run pantheon:report) that call into pantheon-cli. Use workspace linking (e.g. workspace:*) for dependencies between packages, and ensure all packages declare "license": "GPL-3.0-only" to follow your monorepo licensing rules
