## 📝 Context Summary

alright — let’s lock the process in first, then move.

I read the four artifacts you attached process, agents, system prompt, anti-patterns plus the “Golden” task. Below is a tight pass that (1) surfaces contradictions/ambiguities, (2) proposes precise fixes with justifications + examples + remediation steps, and (3) moves the Golden task forward strictly by the process append-only update, and only after creating the right “In Progress” state.

# Findings

## A. Direct contradictions

* `process.md` defines many stages (New, Breakdown, Prompt Refinement, Agent Thinking, Blocked, In Review, Document, Rejected, etc.).&#x20;
* `agents.md` only maps hashtags → columns for a **subset** (`#IceBox, #Accepted, #Ready, #Todo, #InProgress, #Done`). Missing several stages above.&#x20;
  ➜ Result: the board generator cannot faithfully represent the full flow.

2. **Status driver conflict front-matter vs hashtags**

* The Golden task’s front-matter says `status: incoming`, while its tags include `#Ready`. That’s two sources of truth, and they disagree.&#x20;
* Process/agents both imply **hashtags** drive the board; front-matter isn’t specified as authoritative. &#x20;

* `agents.md` says “Task
