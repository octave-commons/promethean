## 🛠️ Task: Expand symdocs and simtasks package documentation

### Context
- `@promethean/docops` README provides detailed usage and troubleshooting guidance, but `@promethean/symdocs` and `@promethean/simtasks` still contain "Usage (coming soon)" placeholders.
- Engineers lack authoritative references when attempting to fix the associated pipelines.
- Aligning package docs improves onboarding and supports reliability work.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Author comprehensive README updates for both packages covering prerequisites, CLI/API usage, cache layout, and troubleshooting.
- [ ] Include example Piper integrations and environment setup instructions consistent with `pipelines.json`.
- [ ] Ensure README sections cross-link to pipeline reports and related tasks.

### Suggested Plan
1. Review existing docops README structure as a template for depth and sections.
2. Interview pipeline configs and scripts to document actual entrypoints and expected inputs/outputs.
3. Draft README content for symdocs and simtasks, including testing instructions and known issues.
4. Solicit review from pipeline maintainers before publishing.
