## Problem\n\nCode duplication analysis revealed significant boilerplate duplication across packages:\n- Identical package.json structures\n- Duplicate test configurations (ava.config.mjs)\n- Repeated TypeScript configurations\n- Common utility patterns reimplemented in each package\n\n## Current State\n\n- Each new package requires manual setup of 15+ files\n- High risk of inconsistencies between packages\n- Developer time wasted on repetitive setup\n- No standardized package patterns\n\n## Solution\n\nCreate a comprehensive package template and generator system that eliminates boilerplate duplication.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Template System Design\n- [ ] Analyze existing package structures for common patterns\n- [ ] Design template architecture with variable substitution\n- [ ] Create template categories (service, library, tool, etc.)\n- [ ] Define configuration schema for template customization\n\n### Phase 2: Core Template Engine\n- [ ] Create  package\n- [ ] Implement template processing with variable substitution\n- [ ] Add support for conditional file inclusion\n- [ ] Create validation for generated packages\n\n### Phase 3: Template Library\n- [ ] Extract common package.json templates\n- [ ] Create TypeScript configuration templates\n- [ ] Build test setup templates (AVA, Jest, etc.)\n- [ ] Design service-specific templates (Fastify, MCP tools, etc.)\n\n### Phase 4: CLI Integration\n- [ ] Create /home/err/.cache/pnpm/dlx/ui32uivw2qb2hel6b3nv7ac52a/199e19c3df3-16fbf7:

No authorization header was set for the request. command\n- [ ] Add interactive template selection\n- [ ] Integrate with existing Nx workspace system\n- [ ] Add template update/migration capabilities\n\n### Phase 5: Documentation & Migration\n- [ ] Document template usage and customization\n- [ ] Create migration guide for existing packages\n- [ ] Add template development guide\n\n## Template Categories\n\n### 1. Service Package Template\n- Fastify server setup\n- Health check endpoints\n- Logging configuration\n- Environment variable handling\n- Docker configuration\n\n### 2. Library Package Template\n- TypeScript library setup\n- Testing configuration\n- Documentation generation\n- Build and publish scripts\n\n### 3. Tool Package Template\n- CLI tool setup\n- Script execution patterns\n- Configuration file handling\n- Error handling patterns\n\n### 4. MCP Package Template\n- MCP server setup\n- Tool registration patterns\n- Configuration schemas\n- Testing utilities\n\n## Files to Create\n\n\n\n## Integration Points\n\n- **Nx Workspace**: Integrate with  commands\n- **pnpm**: Support /home/err/.cache/pnpm/dlx/ui32uivw2qb2hel6b3nv7ac52a/199e19c40b1-16fc27:
