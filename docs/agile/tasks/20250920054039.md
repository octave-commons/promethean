## 📝 Context Summary

### Typical Current Unorganized AdHoc Flow with weak transitions

Often times I do a lot of work on one of my local dev environments
Then when I have a lot of small codex tasks, I merge them all into the
branch I was working on locally and create a mega PR
It is easier to deal with merge conflicts before trying to get into a mainline branch
Often times, this `dev/:hostname` branch goes directly into `main`
When I am feeling more discaplined I might fork a `feat/:featname` from my local dev, and then create a PR
targeting the main branch.

There is not any way for me to say in github right now that one pr is blocked by another,
because it is based on that branch.

I usually *keep* the `dev/:hostname` and delete `codex/:taskname`, `feat/:featname`, etc
Github will automaticly retarget a pr if the branch it was targeting was merged into main, then deleted.
I've experimented with this, it does not automaticly retarget the PR if the branch is merged into it's target, but not deleted.
The PR still targets that branch.

What this ends up doing to me if I base work off of the hostname branch is that I have work that I may not even be doing on that host name, targeting that hostname.
