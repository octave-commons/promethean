Expand test coverage for packages/compiler/src/:\n- AST transformation edge cases and error recovery\n- Lisp-to-JS transformation logic completeness\n- Parser error handling and recovery mechanisms\n- Code generation edge cases and performance benchmarks\n- Integration tests for compilation pipeline\n\nCurrent coverage: 72.35% with gaps in transformation logic. Important for code generation reliability in the Promethean system.
