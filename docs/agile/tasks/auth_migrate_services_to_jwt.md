Auth: Migrate services to JWT-based auth

Goal: Replace ad hoc/static tokens with OAuth2 client_credentials + JWT across internal HTTP endpoints.

Scope (initial wave):
- SmartGPT Bridge: require Bearer JWT; verify scopes: `indexer:write`, `indexer:remove`, `search:read`.
- File Watcher: request token and attach Authorization header.
- Heartbeat service (JS): if any HTTP endpoints exposed later, protect; otherwise, skip.
- Cephalon HTTP endpoints (if any) + internal bridges.
- Broker (WS): evaluate minimal token on connect (optional phase 2).

Exit Criteria:
- Services accept/verify JWT; file-watcher and bridge communicate successfully.
- Docs updated to remove static token guidance.
