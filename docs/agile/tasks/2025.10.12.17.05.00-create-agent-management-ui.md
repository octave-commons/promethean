## Overview

Create a web-based user interface for agent management that provides visual oversight of agent assignments, status monitoring, and management operations integrated with the kanban board.

## Description

Build a comprehensive agent management UI that:
- Displays real-time agent status and assignments
- Provides visual agent management interface
- Integrates with existing kanban board UI
- Offers agent performance monitoring dashboards
- Supports assignment and unassignment operations
- Provides alerts and notifications for agent issues

<AgentAssignmentCard task={task} agent={agent} />

// Management interfaces
<AgentControlPanel agent={agent} />
<AssignmentModal task={task} availableAgents={agents} />

// Monitoring displays
<AgentHealthDashboard agents={agents} />
<PerformanceMetrics agent={agent} />

// Alerts and notifications
<AlertPanel alerts={alerts} />
<NotificationCenter notifications={notifications} />
```
