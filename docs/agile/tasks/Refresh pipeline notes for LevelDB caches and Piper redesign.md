## 🛠️ Task: Refresh pipeline notes for LevelDB caches and Piper redesign

### Context
- `docs/notes/promethean-ci-cd-pipeline.md` still describes pipelines emitting JSON artefacts, predating the LevelDB cache migration and Piper orchestration.
- Current runs persist LevelDB state and use Piper fingerprinting, causing confusion for operators referencing outdated docs.
- Updating the notes aligns onboarding material with actual runtime behaviour.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Audit `docs/notes/promethean-ci-cd-pipeline.md` (and related notes) for outdated references to artefact formats or orchestration flow.
- [ ] Document the current Piper lifecycle, cache layout (`.cache/piper.level`), and dependency requirements (e.g., Ollama models).
- [ ] Note any remaining deltas or TODOs for future automation enhancements.

### Suggested Plan
1. Compare the note’s described pipeline outputs with the actual files generated during DocOps runs.
2. Update sections on artefacts, caching, and orchestrator behaviour to reflect the LevelDB-backed design.
3. Cross-link to Piper package documentation for deeper implementation details.
4. Flag any areas needing follow-up tasks (e.g., diagrams, CLI references).
