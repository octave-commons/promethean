## 🔐 Critical Security: Authorization & Access Control

### Problem Summary
MCP tools currently lack proper authorization and access control mechanisms for destructive operations, creating a critical security vulnerability where unauthorized users can perform dangerous actions.

### Technical Details
- **Component**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools
- **Vulnerability Type**: Missing Authorization
- **Impact**: Unauthorized Destructive Operations
- **Risk Level**: Critical (P0)

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Security Analysis & Design (3 hours)
- [ ] Audit all MCP tools for destructive operations
- [ ] Identify current authorization gaps and vulnerabilities
- [ ] Design role-based access control (RBAC) framework
- [ ] Define permission levels and operation categories
- [ ] Create security requirements specification

#### Phase 2: Authorization Implementation (6 hours)
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware for MCP tools
- [ ] Create permission validation system
- [ ] Add role-based access controls to destructive operations
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all destructive actions
- [ ] Create authorization configuration management
- [ ] Add security context to MCP requests

#### Phase 3: Security Testing (3 hours)
- [ ] Create comprehensive security test suite
- [ ] Test authorization bypass attempts
- [ ] Verify role-based permissions work correctly
- [ ] Test audit logging completeness
- [ ] Perform penetration testing on MCP tools

#### Phase 4: Deployment & Hardening (2 hours)
- [ ] Deploy authorization system with feature flags
- [ ] Configure production security policies
- [ ] Add security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Update MCP documentation with security guidelines
- [ ] Conduct security review and sign-off

### Definition of Done
- All destructive operations require proper authorization
- Role-based access control is fully implemented
- Comprehensive audit logging is in place
- Security test suite passes with 100% coverage
- No unauthorized access possible
- Security team approval obtained
- Documentation updated with security guidelines

### Blocking Dependencies
- Security team review and approval
- Authentication system availability
- Feature flag infrastructure

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: High (core security modification)
- **Security Risk**: Critical (active vulnerability)
- **Business Risk**: High (potential system compromise)

### Security Requirements
- Multi-layered authorization checks
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Real-time security monitoring
- Role-based access controls
