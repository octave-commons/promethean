- migrate-heartbeat-service-to-ts (complexity 2, 2 hours)
- migrate-vision-service-to-ts (complexity 4, 6 hours)
- migrate-eidolon-field-service-to-ts (complexity 3, 4 hours)
- evaluate-optional-js-services-for-migration (complexity 2, 2 hours)

## Next Steps

Each individual service migration task is now in the breakdown column with appropriate complexity estimates and can be worked on independently.
