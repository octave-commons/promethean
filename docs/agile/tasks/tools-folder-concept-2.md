description: >-
  Explains the role of the 'tools' folder in organizing and utilizing predefined
  tools for tasks, emphasizing its similarity to standard directory structures
  like dist or src. The robot leverages tools it's trained on and discovers new
  ones dynamically.

I think tools is going to be one of those special folder names/words like dist/ src/ docs/, etc.
The robot understands "tools" it's trained on the idea of tools.
I'll use tools it knows about.
This means it'll use the tools advertised to it,
but also tools it finds.

When asked to create a tool, it will put it in the tools folder. It's a tool.
It's all just language
