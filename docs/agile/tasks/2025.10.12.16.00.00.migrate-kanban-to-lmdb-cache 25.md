## 🔄 Migration: Kanban Package to LMDB Cache

### Problem Summary

Migrate the kanban package from @promethean/level-cache to @promethean/lmdb-cache for improved performance and concurrency.

### Technical Details

- **Component**: Kanban Package
- **Migration Type**: Dependency Upgrade
- **Impact**: Performance and concurrency improvements
- **Priority**: P1 (Performance enhancement)

### Migration Benefits

- Better performance with LMDB
- Improved concurrency handling
- Drop-in replacement compatibility
- Enhanced cache reliability

### Breakdown Tasks

#### Phase 1: Analysis (2 hours)

- [ ] Analyze current level-cache usage in kanban package
- [ ] Identify all cache operations and dependencies
- [ ] Review LMDB cache API compatibility
- [ ] Plan migration strategy
- [ ] Identify potential breaking changes

#### Phase 2: Migration (4 hours)

- [ ] Update package.json dependencies
- [ ] Replace level-cache imports with lmdb-cache
- [ ] Update cache initialization code
- [ ] Test cache operations compatibility
- [ ] Handle any API differences
- [ ] Update configuration if needed

#### Phase 3: Testing (2 hours)

- [ ] Test all kanban operations with new cache
- [ ] Verify performance improvements
- [ ] Test concurrency scenarios
- [ ] Validate cache persistence
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling

#### Phase 4: Deployment (1 hour)

- [ ] Deploy migration to production
- [ ] Monitor cache performance
- [ ] Validate all kanban functionality
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Kanban package successfully migrated to lmdb-cache
- [ ] All cache operations work correctly
- [ ] Performance improvements are realized
- [ ] No regression in kanban functionality
- [ ] Concurrency handling is improved
- [ ] Migration is transparent to users

### Definition of Done
