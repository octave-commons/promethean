## 🛠️ Task: write simple ecosystem declaration library for new agents

Create a lightweight module that lets each agent declare which
services or processes it needs. The goal is a shared "ecosystem"
format—likely a JS or JSON file—that PM2 or similar tools can read to
spawn the correct services for an agent.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a single declaration file per agent (e.g. `duck.ecosystem.js`)
- Make it easy to add new agents without copying boilerplate
- Integrate with pm2 so `pm2 start duck.ecosystem.js` just works

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Define the declaration schema (services, env vars, command)
- [ ] Implement a loader that reads the file and spawns processes
- [ ] Document usage in `docs/` and reference `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Clarify how this interacts with the Makefile PM2 targets

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Draft an example for Duck using existing service commands
- [ ] Write a small Node script `ecosystem-loader.js`
- [ ] Test launching Cephalon, STT and TTS for one agent
- [ ] Add instructions in `agents/README.md`

## ❓ Questions

- Should PM2 remain the default process manager or is a custom tool planned?
- How will per-agent environment variables be stored?
