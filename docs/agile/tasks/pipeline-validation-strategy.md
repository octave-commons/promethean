Keep the thoughts together when you are bouncing around like this and not actually getting any thing done it means you have a bunch of ideas, and like half a plan,
and it's all in your head, and parts of one plan bleeeed into the others.

So what were we thinking about? What were the threads?
- Helping greg validate his codex sdk works on ubuntu
- Start a pipeline validation worktree with it's own branch
  - Document what steps of which pipelines work correctly
  - Catalog all errors encountered
  - ensure the current documentation surrounding the pipelines is accurate
  - Ensure every pipeline is idempotent
  - Ensure every pipeline
