## 🛠️ Task: Research GitHub Projects board API

We need to understand how to interact programmatically with GitHub Projects so our kanban board can sync with it.

- Note authentication requirements and rate limits
- Decide if a GitHub Action or local script will perform the sync

- [x] Summarize required auth tokens

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [x] Experiment with basic calls via `curl`
- [x] Outline how board data maps to GitHub structures
