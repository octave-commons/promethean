## Overview\n\nOptimize kanban workflow flow and implement automated bottleneck resolution to improve task velocity and reduce manual intervention.\n\n## Current Flow Issues\n\nBased on board analysis and process compliance review:\n\n1. **Incoming Backlog**: 289 tasks stuck in incoming (38% of total tasks)\n2. **Underutilized Capacity**: In-progress column only 38% utilized\n3. **Flow Bottlenecks**: Tasks not advancing through workflow stages\n4. **Manual Triage Overhead**: Excessive manual board grooming required\n5. **Process Violations**: Inconsistent application of FSM transition rules\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Incoming Reduction**: Reduce incoming backlog from 289 to ≤150 tasks\n- **Flow Velocity**: Increase task completion rate by 50%\n- **Bottleneck Resolution**: 90% of bottlenecks resolved automatically\n- **Process Compliance**: Maintain 95%+ FSM rule adherence\n- **Manual Intervention**: Reduce manual board grooming by 80%\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] Automated triage system implemented\n- [ ] Bottleneck detection algorithm operational\n- [ ] Capacity optimization system deployed\n- [ ] Process compliance automation functional\n- [ ] Flow analytics dashboard available\n- [ ] MCP integration for real-time monitoring\n- [ ] Agent workflow optimization complete\n- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
