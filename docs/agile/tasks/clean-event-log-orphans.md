## Objective
Remove or archive the orphaned event log entries (e.g., `security-test-1`, `stress-task-*`, `../../../etc/passwd`) reported by `pnpm kanban audit`, keeping the audit output noise-free and ensuring the log reflects real tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify the source of the orphaned events and document the removal strategy.
- [ ] Clean up the event log or migrate historical entries so future audits run clean.
- [ ] Confirm `pnpm kanban audit` reports no orphaned events once cleanup is complete.
- [ ] Document the process so future orphans can be handled consistently.
