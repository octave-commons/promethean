# Standardize Health Check Utilities Across Services

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit existing health check implementations across services
- [ ] Create standardized health check interface/base class
- [ ] Implement common health check patterns (database, external APIs)
- [ ] Replace duplicate health check code with shared utilities
- [ ] Add health check metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Update all services to use standardized health checks
- [ ] Add health check documentation and examples

## Implementation Details
1. **Audit Phase**: Find all health check implementations in the codebase
2. **Interface Design**: Create @promethean/health-check package
3. **Common Patterns**: Implement database, API, and system health checks
4. **Migration**: Replace duplicate code with shared utilities
5. **Metrics Integration**: Add Prometheus/metrics support
6. **Documentation**: Create usage guide and best practices

## Dependencies
- None (can be done independently)
- Should coordinate with service owners for migration

## Complexity Estimate: 3 (Fibonacci)
- Audit & Design: 0.5 days
- Implementation: 1.5 days
- Migration: 0.5 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days

## Exit Criteria
All services use standardized health check utilities with consistent interfaces and metrics.
