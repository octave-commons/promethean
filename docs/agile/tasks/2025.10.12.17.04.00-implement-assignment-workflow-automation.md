## Overview

Implement intelligent assignment workflow automation that can automatically assign suitable agents to tasks based on task properties, agent availability, and historical performance data.

## Description

Create an automated assignment system that:
- Analyzes task requirements and agent capabilities
- Automatically assigns suitable agents to eligible tasks
- Handles agent workload balancing and distribution
- Learns from assignment success/failure patterns
- Provides manual override and correction capabilities
- Integrates with existing kanban workflow and status transitions

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- `@promethean/kanban` - existing kanban system
- `@promethean/agent-ecs` - agent capability system
- `@promethean/level-cache` - assignment data storage
- Machine learning libraries for optimization

### Integration Points
- Extend `packages/kanban/src/lib/` with automation functionality
- Integrate with existing assignment commands
- Use kanban event system for workflow triggers
- Coordinate with agent management and monitoring

### API Design
```bash
# Automation commands
pnpm kanban auto-assign --dry-run
pnpm kanban auto-assign --limit 5
pnpm kanban auto-assign --agent-type codex

# Assignment rules
pnpm kanban assignment-rules list
pnpm kanban assignment-rules add <rule>
pnpm kanban assignment-rules remove <rule-id>

# Workload management
pnpm kanban workload balance
pnpm kanban workload report
pnpm kanban workload agent <agent-id>

# Learning and optimization
pnpm kanban assignment-analytics
pnpm kanban assignment-optimize --days 30
```
