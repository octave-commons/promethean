# Test Integration Task for Testing→Review Transition

## Code Review Context: Critical Testing Gap (C Grade)

**Priority Update**: This task addresses the critical testing coverage gap identified in code review. Testing infrastructure requires immediate enhancement across all packages.

## Updated Scope

### Enhanced Testing Requirements

- [ ] Implement comprehensive integration tests for kanban transitions
- [ ] Add coverage validation for testing→review workflow
- [ ] Create automated test execution for transition rules
- [ ] Build test data management for transition scenarios
- [ ] Add performance testing for transition validation

### Quality Standards

- [ ] Achieve 90%+ coverage for transition logic
- [ ] Test all edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Validate transition rule enforcement
- [ ] Test WIP limit compliance
- [ ] Verify audit trail functionality

## Implementation Details

Based on code review findings, this task now includes:

- Enhanced test coverage requirements
- Integration with comprehensive testing suite
- Validation of critical workflow components
- Performance and reliability testing

## Dependencies

- Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation (new P0 task)
- Kanban transition rules validation
- Test infrastructure enhancement

## Updated Complexity Estimate: 5 (Fibonacci)

**Note**: Increased complexity due to expanded scope addressing critical testing gaps identified in code review.

## Exit Criteria

Comprehensive integration tests validate all kanban transition scenarios with high coverage and performance requirements met.
