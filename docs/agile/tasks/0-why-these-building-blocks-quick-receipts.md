## 📝 Context Summary

Absolutely. Here’s **Pantheon — Part 4: runnable skeleton + ops knobs**. It’s concrete enough to drop into your monorepo and start iterating tonight, while staying faithful to your rules: **night = local-only; zero cloud fallback**.

I’m weaving in sources where it matters (vLLM continuous batching / PagedAttention, QLoRA, Toolformer, Qwen function-calling, OpenVINO agent path) so you can sanity-check the design choices.

# 0) Why these building blocks (quick receipts)

- **Throughput at night** comes from **continuous batching** + **PagedAttention** (vLLM). This amortizes prefill and packs concurrent jobs efficiently—exactly what your many tiny, repeatable ops need. ([VLLM Docs][1])
- **Specialization without VRAM pain** = **QLoRA** adapters on your traces (4-bit base + low-rank adapters). Proven path for local finetuning. ([arXiv][2])
- **Tool-use reliability** = Qwen’s function-calling + strict JSON schemas and a deterministic loop; there’s a **Qwen-Agent** + **OpenVINO** example for fully local deployments. ([Qwen][3])
- **Trace mining for tool-calls** mirrors **Toolformer’s** self-supervised pattern: small models learn when/how to call tools from examples. ([arXiv][4])
