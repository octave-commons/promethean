## 🛠️ Task: Catalog and normalize mermaid flow diagrams

### Background
- Mermaid flowcharts are embedded across documentation without a shared catalog or styling rules.
- Known diagrams live in `README.md`, `packages/schema/README.md`, and `packages/cephalon/docs/graph/cephalon-knowledge.md`.
- Contributors need a single source to review, update, and extend system flow visualizations.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Inventory all existing Mermaid diagrams across the repository and record their purpose, owner, and update cadence.
- [ ] Propose a canonical location (or index file) for storing diagrams and link back to the original context.
- [ ] Define normalization guidelines covering themes, node naming, and dependency notation so future diagrams stay consistent.
- [ ] Document the consolidation plan and decisions inside the shared catalog so subsequent contributors can follow it.

### Suggested Steps
1. Search the repo for the string `\`\`\`mermaid` and review each diagram's scope.
2. Draft a catalog document (e.g., `docs/diagrams/INDEX.md`) that lists each flow with links and metadata.
3. Align the diagram styles against Promethean documentation standards and capture reusable snippets or templates.
4. Circulate recommendations with affected package owners, updating the catalog with sign-off notes or follow-up actions.
