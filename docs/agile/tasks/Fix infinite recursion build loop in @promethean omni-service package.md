The omni-service package has an infinite recursion issue in its build script:

## Root Cause:
- Package.json build script calls 'pnpm build' which creates endless loop
- Build command references itself instead of running actual compilation

## Relevant Files:
- [[packages/omni-service/package.json]] - Build script configuration
- Need to define proper build command (likely tsc build)

Priority: P1 - Blocking all builds and tests
