## 📋 Task Breakdown

### Subtask 1: Analyze codebase structure and identify key areas
- **Story Points**: 0.5
- **Description**: Survey the codebase to identify main directories, file types, and components that likely contain undocumented patterns
- **Deliverable**: Codebase structure map with priority areas identified

### Subtask 2: Scan for common undocumented patterns
- **Story Points**: 0.5
- **Description**: Search for typical undocumented patterns like magic numbers, complex algorithms, business logic, and architectural decisions
- **Deliverable**: List of undocumented code patterns with file locations

### Subtask 3: Categorize and prioritize findings
- **Story Points**: 0.5
- **Description**: Group patterns by type (algorithms, business rules, architectural patterns) and prioritize by impact and complexity
- **Deliverable**: Categorized catalog with priority rankings

### Subtask 4: Create documentation recommendations
- **Story Points**: 0.5
- **Description**: Generate specific documentation recommendations for each pattern category
- **Deliverable**: Documentation action plan with templates and examples

## 🎯 Success Criteria

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major code areas analyzed
2. **Pattern Classification**: Clear categorization of undocumented patterns
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific documentation guidance provided
4. **Priority Framework**: Clear ranking of documentation efforts by impact

## 📊 Acceptance Tests

- [ ] Codebase structure analysis completed
- [ ] At least 10 undocumented patterns identified and cataloged
- [ ] Patterns categorized by type and complexity
- [ ] Documentation recommendations created for each category
- [ ] Priority list generated for documentation efforts
