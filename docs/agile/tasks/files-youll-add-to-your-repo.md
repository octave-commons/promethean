## 📝 Context Summary

Great links — they change the plan a bit. Short version: use **Aider’s Polyglot benchmark** for coding and **BFCL** for tool use. Both have solid, actively maintained harnesses and are already wired for OpenAI-compatible endpoints (which Ollama can expose). Unsloth’s Qwen3 GGUFs also support **/think** vs **/no_think**, so we’ll test both. ([Aider][1])

Below is a single, opinionated bash script that:

* builds multiple **Ollama** variants from local GGUFs (you can mix 8B/14B, and different quants)
* runs **Aider Polyglot** (in Docker, as the harness recommends) and collects Pass-1/Pass-2
* runs **BFCL** (tool use) against your **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint
* compares **/think** vs **/no_think** modes for Qwen3 (important for coding accuracy & latency)

> Reality check: BFCL measures *function/tool calling*. If you point it at a plain base instruct model with no function-calling finetune, don’t expect pretty scores. If you want a fair “tool use” comparison for open models, add at least one purpose-built FC model (e.g., Gorilla OpenFunctions) as a reference. ([Gorilla][2])
