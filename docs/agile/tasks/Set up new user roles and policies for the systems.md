# Description

Right now we only have an admin role and a simple policy matrix.
We want to be able to set up policies easily through an interface and config files.

We want permissions to be fine grain, such that I could lock an agent into ./docs, forbid specific files with in docs to that same agent, prevent writes to certain files

We want it to be more than "yes" or "no" we want levels of approval like "yes", "no", "with explicit permission from user in a session", "with explicit permission from user every time", possibly defining the user that can give permission to be another agent who is solely responsible for managing certain kinds of permissions.
