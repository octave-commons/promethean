## Context

The CI pipeline is failing on `packages/smartgpt-bridge` grep adapter tests. We need to reproduce the failure locally to understand what's causing the grep parity issue with ripgrep.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Local test environment set up
- [ ] Failing test reproduced with stack traces
- [ ] Root cause identified (rejection signature analysis)
- [ ] Test failure documented with reproduction steps
- [ ] Comparison with expected ripgrep behavior

## Technical Details

**Test to Reproduce:**

```
packages › smartgpt-bridge › dist › tests › unit › grep › grep: matches ripgrep output with context and flags
```

**Files to Examine:**

- `packages/smartgpt-bridge/src/rg.ts` - grep implementation
- `packages/smartgpt-bridge/tests/unit/grep/` - test fixtures
- Test logs and error messages

**Investigation Steps:**

1. Run the specific failing test locally
2. Capture full stack traces and error details
3. Compare actual vs expected output
4. Analyze the rejection/error handling
5. Test edge cases that might trigger the issue

## Acceptance Criteria

- Test failure reproduced consistently
- Root cause clearly identified
- Error signature documented
- Fix approach determined
- Test environment documented for future debugging
