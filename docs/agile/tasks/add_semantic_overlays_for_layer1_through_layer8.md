## 🛠️ Task: Add semantic overlays for layer1 through layer8

Implement documentation overlays that explain how each cognitive layer maps to the system. These overlays should provide conceptual context for the eight circuits described in the design docs.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Mirror the eight circuits with dedicated documentation sections
- Provide consistent naming conventions and tags for each layer
- Clarify the relationship between circuits and system modules

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Create markdown stubs for each layer under `docs/design/circuits/`
- [ ] Include links back to relevant services or agents
- [ ] Tag each doc with `#layerX` where `X` is 1-8

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Draft outline for each circuit overlay
- [ ] Link overlays from the main design overview
- [ ] Update Kanban board when overlays are complete
