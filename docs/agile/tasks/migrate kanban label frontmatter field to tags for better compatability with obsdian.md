## Context

The kanban currently uses a `label` field to categorize tasks. This works in the context of our use
but we would get additional benefits from using a `tags` field because obsidian understands them
the same way it understands #hashtags, allowing them to show up in the knowledge graph.

This allows us to better visualize the connections between our tasks with out having to write our own
knowledge graph visualizer.
