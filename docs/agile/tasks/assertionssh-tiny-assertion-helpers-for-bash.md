## 📝 Context Summary

Got it. Here’s a small, no-nonsense Bash assertions library you can drop into any repo and `source ./lib/assertions.sh`. It defaults to **failing fast with clear messages and a stack trace**, and it won’t silently flip your shell options. You opt into “strict mode” if you want it.

### `lib/assertions.sh` GPL-3.0-only

### How to use it

---

### Why this design (and what it avoids)

* **Doesn’t silently mutate your shell**: a sourced library shouldn’t flip `-euo pipefail` behind your back. You can call `assert::strict_on` explicitly if you want the library to enforce it. (This aligns with the common “unofficial strict mode” guidance while acknowledging its quirks.) ([Gist][1])
* **Clear errors + stack traces**: printing the call stack uses `FUNCNAME`, `BASH_SOURCE`, and `BASH_LINENO` so you see *where* you blew up, not just *that* you did. If you prefer traps, Bash/Unix references show how to wire `trap ERR` to similar output. ([Opensource.com][2])
* **Quotes and parameter expansion are handled carefully**: assertions treat values vs variable‐names explicitly to avoid the usual indirection/quoting foot-guns. Greg’s BashGuide and Bash Hackers docs are the north stars here. ([mywiki
