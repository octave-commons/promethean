## 🛠️ Description

Production systems lack load and stress testing to validate performance under realistic conditions. Voice processing, AI service integration, and concurrent user handling need systematic performance validation.

**What changed?** No systematic testing of system behavior under load, concurrent usage, or stress conditions.

**Where is the impact?** Production systems including voice agent, AI services, and real-time processing components.

**Why now?** Production deployments need confidence that systems can handle expected load and degrade gracefully under stress.

**Supporting context**: Voice agent handles concurrent Discord sessions, AI services process multiple requests, but no load testing exists for these scenarios.

## Goals

- Implement load testing framework for production systems
- Validate system performance under expected concurrent load
- Test graceful degradation under stress conditions
- Establish performance baselines and SLAs

## Requirements

- [ ] Load testing framework integration (Artillery, k6)
- [ ] Concurrent user simulation for voice agent sessions
- [ ] AI service load testing with realistic request patterns
- [ ] Database and message broker performance under load
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and SLA validation

## Subtasks

1. Research and select load testing framework (Artillery, k6)
2. Create load testing scenarios for voice agent concurrent sessions
3. Implement AI service load testing with realistic request patterns
4. Add database performance testing under concurrent load
5. Create message broker load testing scenarios
6. Implement memory and CPU stress testing
7. Add performance benchmarking and baseline establishment
8. Create automated performance regression testing
9. Implement load testing in CI/CD pipeline
10. Create performance monitoring and alerting integration
