CRITICAL: TypeScript compilation errors blocking all development\n\n**Issues Identified:**\n- Unterminated string literal in src/ecosystem.ts line 341\n- Multiple syntax errors preventing compilation\n- Duplicate code blocks causing parsing issues\n\n**Impact:**\n- Build system completely broken\n- No type checking possible\n- Blocking all dependent development\n\n**Files Affected:**\n- src/ecosystem.ts (primary issue)\n- Package build pipeline\n\n**Story Points: 3**\n\n**Required Actions:**\n1. Fix unterminated string literal in ecosystem.ts\n2. Remove duplicate code blocks\n3. Ensure clean compilation\n4. Verify type checking passes\n5. Test build process\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- TypeScript compilation passes without errors\n- All type checks succeed\n- Build process completes successfully\n- No syntax errors remain
