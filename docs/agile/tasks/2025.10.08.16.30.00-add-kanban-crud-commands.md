## Context

The kanban CLI currently supports read operations and status updates, but lacks full CRUD functionality for task management. Adding create, read, update, delete operations will make the CLI more comprehensive for task management.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `kanban create` command to create new tasks
- [ ] `kanban show` command to display task details
- [ ] `kanban edit` command to modify task properties
- [ ] `kanban delete` command to remove tasks
- [ ] Input validation and error handling
- [ ] Help documentation and examples
- [ ] Integration with existing task schema

## Technical Details

**New Commands:**

```bash
kanban create "Task title" --priority P1 --labels tag1,tag2
kanban show <uuid>
kanban edit <uuid> --title "New title" --priority P2
kanban delete <uuid> [--confirm]
```

**Implementation Areas:**

- Task creation with frontmatter generation
- Task file I/O operations
- UUID generation and validation
- Schema validation for task properties
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations

**File Operations:**

- Create new task files in `docs/agile/tasks/`
- Update existing task files
- Delete task files with confirmation
- Maintain file naming conventions

## Acceptance Criteria

- All CRUD commands work correctly
- Tasks are created with proper frontmatter
- File operations handle edge cases gracefully
- Input validation prevents invalid data
- Help text is clear and comprehensive
- Commands integrate well with existing kanban workflow
