## 📝 Context Summary

Context management is also an important feature of the enso protocol.
A users own contributions of a given conversation must be both visible, and controllable.
Users should be able to curate files/data sources for LLM usage, a data source can have several properties.
The specifics as to how the following are implemented can vary by implementation, but all must be present:

## Metadata

- owner(s): the user(s) or group(s) who owns a piece of data, and is allowed to decide it's availability to contexts
- source: Where is this data from? (fs, api, database, etc)
- location: How the data source is uniquely identified by a source.

## Discoverability

To a given context instance, a data source may be explicitly, or implicitly:

- invisible: The protocol is unaware of its existance
- discoverable: The protocol is able to discover this assets existance if there are links to it from a context session
- visible: The protocol is aware of it's existance
- hidden: Distinct from invisible, can only be found with a direct reference.

Explicitly a user can set these states ephemerally to a specific context for a data source. This is forgotten at the end of the context
Implicitly, a user can contr
