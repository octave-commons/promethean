## Overview\n\nCoordinate and integrate all kanban healing initiatives into a cohesive, automated system that proactively maintains board health, resolves issues, and optimizes workflow efficiency.\n\n## Epic Summary\n\nThis epic orchestrates the comprehensive healing of the kanban system through 7 major initiatives:\n\n1. **MCP-Kanban Integration Healing** (P0) - Critical security and integration fixes\n2. **Kanban System Health Monitoring** (P1) - Proactive monitoring and alerting\n3. **Task Quality & Content Validation** (P1) - Automated quality enforcement\n4. **Workflow Optimization & Bottleneck Resolution** (P1) - Flow efficiency improvements\n5. **Migration & Cleanup Automation** (P1) - System maintenance automation\n6. **Agent Workflow Enhancement** (P1) - Agent healing capabilities\n7. **Documentation & Process Compliance** (P2) - Knowledge management and compliance\n\n## Coordination Requirements\n\n### 1. Integration Dependencies\n- **Security First**: MCP-Kanban healing must complete before other integrations\n- **Data Flow**: Health monitoring provides data for all other healing operations\n- **Quality Foundation**: Task validation enables effective workflow optimization\n- **Automation Backbone**: Migration framework supports all system updates\n\n### 2. Phased Implementation\n\n\n### 3. Cross-cutting Concerns\n- **Performance**: All healing operations must meet performance benchmarks\n- **Security**: Healing operations must maintain security posture\n- **Reliability**: Healing systems must be highly reliable and self-healing\n- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging for all healing operations\n\n## Success Metrics (Epic Level)\n\n### System Health Metrics\n- **Board Health Score**: Maintain ≥90% overall board health\n- **Issue Resolution Time**: 80% of issues resolved within 1 hour\n- **Proactive Prevention**: 90% of issues prevented before human detection\n- **System Uptime**: 99.9% kanban system availability\n\n### Operational Efficiency Metrics\n- **Manual Intervention**: 90% reduction in manual board maintenance\n- **Task Quality**: 95% of tasks meet quality standards automatically\n- **Flow Velocity**: 50% improvement in task completion rate\n- **Agent Efficiency**: 70% reduction in agent overhead for board management\n\n### Integration Success Metrics\n- **MCP Integration**: 100% security compliance and real-time synchronization\n- **Agent Adoption**: 80% of agents using healing capabilities\n- **Documentation Accuracy**: 98% documentation accuracy rate\n- **Process Compliance**: 95% adherence to documented processes\n\n## Risk Management\n\n### Technical Risks\n- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigated by phased approach and comprehensive testing\n- **Performance Impact**: Addressed through benchmarking and optimization\n- **Data Integrity**: Ensured through validation and rollback capabilities\n\n### Operational Risks\n- **Change Management**: Mitigated through comprehensive training and documentation\n- **Agent Adoption**: Addressed through intuitive interfaces and clear benefits\n- **System Dependencies**: Managed through careful dependency mapping and testing\n\n## Definition of Done (Epic Level)\n\n- [ ] All 7 healing initiatives completed and integrated\n- [ ] Cross-initiative testing and validation complete\n- [ ] Performance benchmarks met across all healing operations\n- [ ] Security audit passed for all healing components\n- [ ] Agent training and adoption programs implemented\n- [ ] Documentation and knowledge base updated\n- [ ] Monitoring and alerting systems operational\n- [ ] Success metrics achieved and sustained for 30 days\n\n## Epic Owner\n\n**Primary**: Task-Board-Manager Agent\n**Supporting**: All agent roles with kanban responsibilities\n\n## Timeline\n\n- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): MCP Security Healing + Health Monitoring Foundation\n- **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): Task Quality + Workflow Optimization\n- **Phase 3** (Week 5-6): Migration Automation + Agent Enhancement\n- **Phase 4** (Week 7-8): Documentation Healing + Integration Testing\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **External**: None - all dependencies are internal to this epic\n- **Internal**: As outlined in phased implementation above\n\n## Related Initiatives\n\n- Infrastructure Stability Cluster (P0) - provides stable foundation\n- Pipeline BuildFix & Automation Epic (P0) - complementary automation work\n- Agent System Optimization - enhanced by healing capabilities
