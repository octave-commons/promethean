Love it. Let’s wire up a sane, minimal-but-powerful “native Emacs” toolbox for gptel. I’m keeping the surface area small, returning plain strings for content-heavy ops (so models don’t have to unescape JSON) and JSON for structured results (lists, trees, search hits). Where something is potentially destructive, I’ve put (lightweight) guardrails.

Below is a drop-in `init.el` snippet that defines **all 10 tools** you asked for and registers them. After evaluating it, enable them via `M-x gptel-menu → tools` or set `gptel-tools` globally as shown.

> Notes up front
> • This follows gptel’s tool spec `gptel-make-tool`, `:args` plist, etc.. See the project’s “Defining gptel tools” section for the canonical shape. ([GitHub][1])
> • For `apply_pat
