## Context

The final step is to ensure the omni-service is properly tested, documented, and deployable. This includes integration tests, deployment guides, and CI automation.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Integration smoke tests for all adapters
- [ ] Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- [ ] Nginx configuration examples
- [ ] Deployment documentation and guides
- [ ] CI pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Performance and load testing setup
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configuration

## Technical Details

**Test Coverage:**

- Health check endpoints
- Authentication flows
- REST API CRUD operations
- GraphQL queries/mutations
- WebSocket message handling
- MCP JSON-RPC calls
- Error scenarios and edge cases

**Deployment Artifacts:**

- Dockerfile with production optimizations
- Docker Compose examples
- Nginx reverse proxy config
- Environment variable templates
- Kubernetes deployment manifests

**CI Integration:**

- Automated test execution
- Security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Build and publish automation

## Acceptance Criteria

- All integration tests pass in CI
- Service builds and runs in Docker
- Nginx proxy configuration works
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- CI pipeline runs successfully
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- Monitoring captures key metrics
