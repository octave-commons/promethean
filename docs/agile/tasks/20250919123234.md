## 📝 Context Summary

Keep the thoughts together when you are bouncing around like this and not actually getting any thing done it means you have a bunch of ideas, and like half a plan,
and it's all in your head, and parts of one plan bleeeed into the others.

So what were we thinking about? What were the threads?
- Helping greg validate his codex sdk works on ubuntu
- Start a pipeline validation worktree with it's own branch
  - Document what steps of which pipelines work correctly
  - Catalog all errors encountered
  - ensure the current documentation surrounding the pipelines is accurate
  - Ensure every pipeline is idempotent
  - Ensure every pipeline does not alter it's inputs in any ways
    - Docops currently runs a bash command that copies the stuff over, then it mutates that. It isn't what I wanted but.. it does do the job I need it to do, except in the case that
    - the files already exist.
    - Maybe it isn't totally possible to not alter them at all...
    - No. No it is. The front matter is not the source of truth. It's generated from the level cache
  - validate behaviors
  - get codex cloud to replicate the full pipeline
    - create a small fixture folder with enough examples to excer
