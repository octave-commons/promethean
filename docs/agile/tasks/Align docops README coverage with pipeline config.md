## 🛠️ Task: Align DocOps README coverage with pipeline config

### Context
- The root README pipeline summary omits the `doc-stage` preprocessing step currently required by `pipelines.json`.
- DocOps reports also reference legacy steps (`doc-references`, `doc-apply-fm`) that no longer exist in configuration.
- Keeping documentation aligned prevents confusion for operators running or debugging DocOps.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Update README pipeline table/section to reflect the current DocOps step sequence (`doc-stage`, `doc-fm`, `doc-index`, `doc-similarity`, `doc-related`, `doc-footer`, `doc-rename`).
- [ ] Remove or revise any outdated references to DocOps steps in docs/agile/pipelines and related notes.
- [ ] Add change notes or pointers for maintainers about the preprocessing stage.

### Suggested Plan
1. Diff the DocOps block in `README.md` against `pipelines.json` to identify mismatches.
2. Update Markdown descriptions and step ordering accordingly.
3. Review DocOps-specific documentation (`docs/agile/pipelines/docops.md`, package README) for consistency.
4. Open follow-up issues if other documents refer to deprecated steps.

### References
- `README.md`
- `pipelines.json`
- `docs/agile/pipelines/docops.md`
- `scripts/piper-docops.mjs`
