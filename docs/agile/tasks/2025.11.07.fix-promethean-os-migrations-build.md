## Summary
- Strict node16 resolution requires explicit `.js` extensions and the migration scripts still rely on implicit any parameters.
- Impact: `pnpm build` remains red for @promethean-os/migrations.

## Failure Evidence
- TS2835: Relative import paths need explicit file extensions
- TS7006: Parameter 'db' implicitly has an 'any' type

## Required Actions
1. Add `.js` extensions and annotate parameters in migration files
2. Rebuild

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build command `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/migrations build` completes without errors
- Root `pnpm build` no longer reports this package as failing
- Tests or smoke checks relevant to @promethean-os/migrations pass
