description: >-
  A compositional system of hyper-specialized agents orchestrated in pipelines
  to handle complex tasks locally, with iterative refinement and fallback to
  cloud models for quality assurance. The design balances specialization, error
  resilience, and incremental improvement through a modular architecture.

Cool, ambitious vision. Let me push back, poke holes, and sketch a scaffolding. If you accept the roughness, we can then refine each piece into a “Pantheon” prototype.

Your goal: get “cloud-model quality” via a compositional graph of small, hyper-specialized agents, orchestrated in pipelines, learning and refining tasks overnight, waking to PRs & reviews. Locally. With a tool/CLI/framework for defining agents, flows, training data, etc.

That is very hard, but not impossib
