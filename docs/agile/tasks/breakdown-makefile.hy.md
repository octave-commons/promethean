## 🛠️ Description
```
**Status:** planning
```
`Makefile.hy` previously orchestrated builds but is now unmaintained. The audit confirms no active workflows call into it, yet
several documents still reference a pending breakdown. This task formalizes the retirement plan and documents any remaining
references that must be redirected to pnpm / TypeScript tooling.

## ✅ Decision
- Treat `Makefile.hy` as legacy; do not resurrect Hy-based generators.
- Capture any residual references so they can be re-pointed to pnpm scripts.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Inventory lingering links to `Makefile.hy` and classify them (documentation vs. tooling).
- Provide recommendations for replacing each reference with pnpm/TS equivalents.
- Deliver a short deprecation memo so future tasks do not reintroduce the Hy pipeline.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [ ] List every reference discovered during the audit (boards, tasks, docs).
- [ ] Note the pnpm/TypeScript alternative for each workflow.
- [ ] Open follow-up tasks (if needed) for high-effort migrations.

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [ ] Search repo for `Makefile.hy` mentions and classify them.
- [ ] Update docs/tasks inline when the fix is trivial; file follow-ups otherwise.
- [ ] Summarize findings in `docs/notes/` alongside the Makefile retirement log.
