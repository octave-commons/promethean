The indexer-core package lacks proper input validation for environment variables, file paths, and user inputs. This creates multiple security vulnerabilities including potential code injection and DoS attacks.\n\n**Validation needed:**\n- Environment variable validation with type checking and length limits\n- File path sanitization and validation\n- Collection name validation (alphanumeric only, max length)\n- Metadata field validation\n- Embedding configuration validation\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n- Create validation utilities with proper error types\n- Add validation at entry points (indexFile, search, etc.)\n- Implement whitelist-based validation for file extensions\n- Add rate limiting for API endpoints\n\n**Files affected:**\n- packages/indexer-core/src/indexer.ts\n- Add new validation module\n\n**Priority:** HIGH - Security hardening
