# Agent Workflow Enhancement & Healing Integration

## Context

Based on board-automation-improvements.md notes and current kanban status showing critical WIP limits:

- accepted: 18/21 (86%)
- breakdown: 19/20 (95%)
- testing: 8/8 (100%)
- review: 7/8 (88%)
- incoming: 143/9999 (1%) - needs reduction to manageable level

## Objectives

### 1. Board Healing Process

- Move excess tasks from incoming to icebox (reduce from 143 to manageable level)
- Fix automation scripts that are hiding tasks and creating overflow
- Implement proper board state management that references process documentation
- Ensure empty columns are not forgotten by automation

### 2. Agent Workflow Enhancement

- Implement monitoring for board health
- Create automated healing processes for WIP limit violations
- Enhance agent coordination for task management
- Integrate with process documentation for proper FSM compliance

### 3. Automation Fixes

- Fix automation scripts that create duplicate tasks
- Implement proper task deduplication
- Add validation to prevent auto-generated task overflow
- Reference process documentation for board structure

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Board Healing (In Progress)

- [x] Identify and move duplicate tasks to icebox
- [x] Remove test/placeholder tasks from incoming
- [ ] Continue moving low-quality auto-generated tasks to icebox
- [ ] Implement monitoring for board health metrics

### Phase 2: Automation Fixes

- [ ] Fix automation scripts that create duplicates
- [ ] Implement task deduplication logic
- [ ] Add validation for task quality before creation
- [ ] Reference process documentation for board structure

### Phase 3: Enhanced Monitoring

- [ ] Create board health monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Implement automated WIP limit alerts
- [ ] Add healing processes for critical states
- [ ] Integrate with agent workflow coordination

### Phase 4: Process Integration

- [ ] Ensure automation references process.md
- [ ] Implement FSM compliance checking
- [ ] Add board state validation
- [ ] Create healing triggers for process violations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Incoming column reduced to <50 tasks
2. No duplicate tasks in board
3. Automation scripts respect process documentation
4. Board health monitoring implemented
5. WIP limit violations trigger automated healing
6. Empty columns are properly tracked by automation

## Dependencies

- Process documentation (docs/agile/process.md)
- Kanban configuration (promethean.kanban.json)
- Board automation scripts
- Agent workflow system
