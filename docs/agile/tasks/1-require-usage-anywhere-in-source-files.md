## 📝 Context Summary

You’re OR-ing in `.` matches almost every non-blank line, which is why it’s noisy. Drop that and tighten both the file set and the regexes.

### Clean, practical ripgrep

**Search JS/TS source only, ignore build/vendor junk, and flag CommonJS usage:**

* `-I` ignores binaries.
* `-g` filters away noisy dirs/files and limits to code extensions.
* The require regex uses a negative lookbehind so `foo.require(` or `required(` don’t match.

### If you also want to catch `.cjs` files (by filename, not content)

Ripgrep matches **content**, not filenames, so list `.cjs` files separately:

### CI/“assert empty” friendly (fails if any CJS is present)

If you want this permanent, put the `-g '!…'` rules into a repo-root `.rgignore` so you don’t repeat yourself.

Does this make sense, and do you want me to tailor the ignore globs to your exact repo layout e.g., `packages/`, `examples/`, `docs/` noise?
