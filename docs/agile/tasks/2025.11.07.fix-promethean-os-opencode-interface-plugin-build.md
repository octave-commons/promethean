## Summary
- The plugin imports `GenericEntry` from persistence even though it is no longer exported.
- Impact: `pnpm build` remains red for @promethean-os/opencode-interface-plugin.

## Failure Evidence
- TS2305: Module '@promethean-os/persistence' has no exported member 'GenericEntry'

## Required Actions
1. Update the plugin to use supported persistence exports or re-export GenericEntry
2. Confirm build passes

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build command `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/opencode-interface-plugin build` completes without errors
- Root `pnpm build` no longer reports this package as failing
- Tests or smoke checks relevant to @promethean-os/opencode-interface-plugin pass
