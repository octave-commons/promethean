### **Task: Integrate SonarQube into DevOps Pipeline**  
```
**Description**:
```
Add SonarQube to your DevOps pipeline to enforce code quality checks, detect bugs, and ensure compliance with coding standards. This involves configuring SonarQube analysis within your CI/CD workflow and aligning it with your team’s development practices.  
```
**Steps**:
```
1. **Set Up SonarQube**: Install and configure SonarQube server, ensuring it is accessible via your DevOps environment.  
2. **Configure Pipeline**: Integrate SonarQube into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI) to run static code analysis during builds.  
3. **Define Quality Gates**: Establish quality gates in SonarQube to block deployments if code quality thresholds (e.g., bug count, code duplication) are not met.  
4. **Automate Reporting**: Generate and publish SonarQube reports (HTML, JSON) for team visibility and compliance tracking.  
5. **Secure Access**: Ensure secure authentication between your pipeline and SonarQube (e.g., via tokens or service accounts).
