Add a new MCP tool too packages/mcp that allow for the asyncronous delegation of tasks to ollama, which them selves are able to use the MCP tools provided by the mcp package, including to create new ollama jobs.

A template might look like:

It should allow you to:
- pull(modelName:string)
- listModels()
