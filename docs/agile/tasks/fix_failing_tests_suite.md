## 🧭 Context
- **What changed?**: Incoming bug report indicates some unit tests in the Promethean monorepo are currently failing on main.
- **Where?**: Tests appear in the shared `tests/` workspace.
- **Why now?**: Keeping regression suite green is required before other teams can merge changes.

## 📥 Inputs / Artifacts
- Local reproduction of failing test output
- Recent CI report documenting failures (see `docs/reports/codex_cloud/describe/latest/summary.tsv`)

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [ ] Identify and document root cause for current failing tests
- [ ] Implement fix with accompanying tests if necessary
- [ ] Confirm the full affected test command passes locally
- [ ] Update changelog entry describing the fix

## 🗺 Plan
1. Run the failing test command to confirm current status and capture error details.
2. Investigate source modules referenced in the failure to understand regression.
3. Implement minimal fix restoring expected behaviour, adding tests if coverage lacking.
4. Re-run tests to ensure suite passes and no new failures introduced.
5. Document changes and update changelog.

## ⚠️ Risks / Open Questions
- Failing tests may depend on external services or data fixtures requiring additional setup.
- Potential mismatch between local environment and CI configuration.
