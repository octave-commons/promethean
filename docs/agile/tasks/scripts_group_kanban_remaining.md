Scripts: Group remaining Kanban utilities and verify

Goal: Ensure all Kanban-related scripts are under `scripts/kanban/` and update their docs.

Scope:
- Move `kanban_to_issues.py` into `scripts/kanban/` (if not already).
- Verify imports (e.g., agile_statuses) and adjust.
- Expand `scripts/kanban/README.md` with each tool's purpose, env vars, and examples.

Exit Criteria:
- All Kanban scripts consolidated; README accurate; sample commands tested.
