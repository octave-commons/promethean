## Context

- Shared package monolith creep was affecting us in difficult to understand ways
- need a dumb, flat, package based system.
- no more dividing anything up by language, or by runtime, each package declares it's structure in a manifest edn file.
- services are packages that spun up as long running background processes
- everything that is not a package is just a config file
- declarative beats imperative.
