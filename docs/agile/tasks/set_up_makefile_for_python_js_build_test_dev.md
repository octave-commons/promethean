## 🛠️ Task: Replace polyglot Makefile with pnpm-first workflow docs

The repo already uses pnpm workspaces, TypeScript scripts, and `scripts/dev.mjs`. Instead of maintaining a cross-language
Makefile, capture the pnpm-based workflow and retire the old automation checklist.

## ✅ Decision
- Treat this initiative as documentation/cleanup—no new Makefile to be written.
- Publish guidance showing how pnpm covers setup, service start, testing, and cleanup.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Provide a pnpm-focused quickstart for setting up JS/TS + any remaining Python helpers.
- Highlight existing scripts `pnpm install`, `pnpm test:all`, `pnpm run clean`, `scripts/dev.mjs`.
- Record that the Makefile experiment is archived and no longer required.

---

## 📦 Requirements
- [ ] Update onboarding docs with pnpm workflow tables.
- [ ] Call out how to execute Python tooling (if any) directly, without Makefile wrappers.
- [ ] Ensure the old Makefile checklist is marked as superseded.

---

## 📋 Subtasks
- [ ] Draft documentation section in README or docs/notes.
- [ ] Remove stale references to `make setup` / `make test` from guides.
- [ ] Link to the Makefile retirement note in `docs/notes/`.
