## 🛠️ Task: Capture confirmation telemetry for daemon optimization triggers

`system/README.md` describes how repeated confirmations of daemon- and condition-driven units trigger optimization events and conversions into structured formats. We need durable telemetry so the framework can count confirmations, audit which context state led to conversions, and surface signals for future automation.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Record confirmation events (synchronous and asynchronous) for daemon/condition workflows with user identity, context snapshot, and outcome metadata.
- Track optimization triggers that fire after enough confirmations, including the source markdown unit and the resulting structured artifact.
- Provide visibility dashboards or logs so operators can verify optimization health and intervene when conversions fail.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Define telemetry schema for confirmation acknowledgements and optimization events (fields, retention, storage location).
- [ ] Instrument the daemon/condition execution path to emit confirmation telemetry in real time.
- [ ] Persist optimization trigger occurrences with linkage to the source markdown unit and generated structured version.
- [ ] Document how to query or visualize the collected telemetry for audit and tuning purposes.

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Inventory existing confirmation pathways (direct vs asynchronous) in the daemon/condition system.
- [ ] Draft schema updates and circulate for review with platform owners.
- [ ] Implement telemetry emission and storage plumbing.
- [ ] Create operator documentation and sample dashboards or queries.
