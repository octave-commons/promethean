## Summary
- Client code still expects persistence to export `GenericEntry`, so the build fails with TS2305 errors across multiple files.
- Impact: `pnpm build` remains red for @promethean-os/opencode-client.

## Failure Evidence
- TS2305 in getAllRelatedDocuments.ts, getLatestDocuments.ts, services/unified-store.ts

## Required Actions
1. Update to new persistence API or re-export GenericEntry
2. Rebuild

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build command `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/opencode-client build` completes without errors
- Root `pnpm build` no longer reports this package as failing
- Tests or smoke checks relevant to @promethean-os/opencode-client pass
