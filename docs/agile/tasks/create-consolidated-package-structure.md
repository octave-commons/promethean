## 📦 Create Consolidated Package Structure

### 📋 Description

Create the unified `@promethean/opencode-unified` package structure that will house the consolidated functionality from `@promethean/opencode-client`, `opencode-cljs-electron`, and `@promethean/dualstore-http`. This involves designing the directory layout, package configuration, and build toolchain to support TypeScript, ClojureScript, and Electron components.

### 🎯 Goals

- Establish clear directory structure for all components
- Create unified package.json with proper dependencies
- Set up TypeScript configuration for all components
- Integrate ClojureScript shadow-cljs build system
- Configure Electron build and packaging

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [x] New package directory structure following Promethean standards
- [x] Unified package.json with all necessary dependencies and scripts
- [x] TypeScript configuration supporting all source files
- [x] ClojureScript shadow-cljs integration
- [x] Electron configuration for main and renderer processes
- [x] Development and production build scripts
- [x] Proper workspace integration with pnpm

### 🔧 Technical Specifications

└── electron-builder.json    # Electron packaging config
```

#### Package Configuration:

- **Dependencies**: Merge dependencies from all three packages
- **Scripts**: Unified build, test, and development scripts
- **Exports**: Proper module exports for all components
- **Peer Dependencies**: Handle shared dependencies correctly

#### Build System Integration:

- **TypeScript**: Support for all TypeScript source files
- **ClojureScript**: shadow-cljs integration with multiple builds
- **Electron**: Main and renderer process builds
- **Development**: Hot reload for all components
- **Production**: Optimized builds for deployment

### 📁 Files/Components to Create

#### Core Configuration Files:

1. **`packages/opencode-unified/package.json`**

   - Unified dependencies and scripts
   - Proper exports and imports
   - Build and development commands

2. **`packages/opencode-unified/tsconfig.json`**

   - TypeScript configuration for all source files
   - Path mappings for clean imports
   - Build targets for different environments

3. **`packages/opencode-unified/shadow-cljs.edn`**

   - ClojureScript build configurations
   - Development and production builds
   - Electron renderer process configuration

4. **`packages/opencode-unified/electron-builder.json`**
   - Electron packaging configuration
   - Build targets for different platforms
   - Asset and resource management

#### Directory Structure:

1. **Source Directories**

   - `src/typescript/` - All TypeScript source code
   - `src/clojurescript/` - All ClojureScript source code
   - `src/schemas/` - Shared type definitions

2. **Build Directories**
   - `dist/` - Build output
   - `static/` - Static assets
   - `tests/` - Test files

### 🧪 Testing Requirements
