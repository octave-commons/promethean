#Todo

## 🛠️ Description

- Capture the follow-up slice for isolating CLI and operational tooling packages under `packages/tools/` (or similar).

## Description
- **What changed?** The frontend reorg established the pattern for nested namespaces and highlighted the need to cluster CLIs separately from runtime libraries.
- **Where is the impact?** Applies to packages that publish binaries or automation scripts `promethean-cli`, `kanban-cli`, `pm2-helpers`, etc..
- **Why now?** Keeps operational tooling discoverable and enables targeted CI/test pipelines.
- **Supporting context** Builds on the staged refactor plan agreed in the earlier discussion.

## Goals
- Define inclusion criteria for tooling vs. libraries.
- Outline new folder structure e.g., `packages/tools/cli`, `packages/tools/ops`.
- Note required updates to release docs and automation scripts.

## Requirements
- [ ] Inventory CLI/tooling packages with owners and release processes.
- [ ] Draft migration plan with acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Ensure Nx/pnpm configs support additional nested directories.
- [ ] Document guidelines for new tooling packages.

## Subtasks
1. Audit packages exposing `bin` entries or CLI commands.
2. Validate proposed structure with maintainers and capture follow-up actions.
3. Stage documentation and automation updates before moving packages.
