## Context

After reproducing the grep test failure, we need to fix the error handling in the SmartGPT Bridge grep adapter to properly handle the edge cases that cause the rejection and ensure parity with ripgrep behavior.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Error handling patched for identified edge cases
- [ ] Grep adapter gracefully handles problematic inputs
- [ ] Test coverage added for regression scenarios
- [ ] All grep tests pass consistently
- [ ] Performance impact minimized
- [ ] Code review and linting completed

## Technical Details

**Potential Issues to Address:**

- Unhandled promise rejections

- Context line handling discrepancies
- Flag interpretation differences
- Memory management for large files

**Implementation Areas:**

- `packages/smartgpt-bridge/src/rg.ts` error handling
- Stream processing robustness
- Async operation management
- Input validation and sanitization

**Testing Strategy:**

- Unit tests for error scenarios
- Integration tests with various file types
- Performance regression tests
- Edge case coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

- All existing grep tests pass

## 🔄 Related PRs & Issues
