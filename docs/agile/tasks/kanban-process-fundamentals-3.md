description: >-
  This document explains the core principles of a Kanban process as a finite
  state machine with defined transitions and blocking conditions. It emphasizes
  how minor interventions are handled without halting workflow, while major
  issues trigger full team coordination. The process avoids rigid gates and
  focuses on natural workflow progression.

I'm saying there isn't a ready to code gate at all. Because the it's all just process.

You're being far too literal about all of this.

I shouldn't have to say anything about the giant inputs.

If I have to dictate all of that, the process is too complex to follow.

The process are the columns on the board.

The phases aren't a part of core process document. That is specific to codex cloud.

The process is a finite state machine.
There is a set of possible states an given task t can be in C
Each state Cn has a s
