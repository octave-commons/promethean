## 📝 Context Summary

What you’re describing is a **multi-LLM routing** system (sometimes also called a prompt router) — you intake a prompt, classify/score it, and send it to the “best” downstream model (or chain) depending on complexity, domain, tone, urgency, etc. There’s a fair bit of recent literature and applied engineering on this. E.g. “Doing More with Less: Implementing Routing Strategies in LLM-based Systems” ([arXiv][1]), “MixLLM: Dynamic Routing in Mixed Large Language Models” ([arXiv][2]), “Building an LLM Router for High-Quality and Cost-Effective Responses” ([Anyscale][3]), and “INFERENCEDYNAMICS: Efficient Routing Across LLMs through Structured Capability and Knowledge Profiling” ([arXiv][4]).

Below I’ll sketch a design path architecture + training strategy + iteration and flag pitfalls / trade-offs. We can then zoom into any piece you like (e.g. training the classifier, building domain models, evaluation).

## Design goals & trade-offs

Before diving into architecture, it helps to explicitly enumerate your optimization goals and constraints, because routing always involves trade-offs:

* **Quality / accuracy / relevance**: you want the final answer to be strong (not degrade by mis
