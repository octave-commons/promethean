## 🛠️ Task: Gather baseline emotion metrics for Eidolon field

Collect initial emotional state data to seed analysis and reward calculations.
These numbers provide a reference point for future reinforcement logic.
The dataset should provide a snapshot of typical emotional vectors generated by
the Eidolon service under neutral conditions. Future evaluation tasks will use
this baseline to detect deviations and compute rewards.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a reproducible baseline dataset of emotion measurements
- Document collection methodology in `notes/math/eidolon-field-math.md`
- Store results in `data/eidolon/baseline.csv`

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [ ] Implement a script `services/eidolon/scripts/collect_baseline.py`
- [ ] Log raw vectors to `data/eidolon/raw/`
- [ ] Summarize averages and ranges in a short report
- [ ] Decide on sampling frequency and duration (e.g., 1 Hz for 5 minutes)
- [ ] Implement `log_metrics.py` in `services/eidolon/` to capture vectors
- [ ] Save raw values to `data/eidolon/baseline.csv`
- [ ] Generate a small markdown report summarizing mean and variance

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [ ] Run initial collection using current Eidolon service (or mock data)
- [ ] Export cleaned results to `data/eidolon/baseline.csv`
- [ ] Update doc `eidolon-field-math.md` with methodology and assumptions
