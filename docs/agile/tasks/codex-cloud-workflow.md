## Codex Cloud — Boot (immutable)
- Open **docs/agents/codex-cloud.md** before anything else.
- Read **docs/reports/codex_cloud/latest/{INDEX.md,summary.tsv,eslint.json}** as the baseline.

## Codex Cloud — Task-first, every session
- Do nothing off-board. Every session must be attached to exactly one task.
- If no fitting task exists, create one in `docs/agile/tasks/` append-only.
- Use a single, canonical status hashtag per task; do not edit the board file.

## Codex Cloud — Artifact guarantee (no empty sessions)
- **At session start (within 1 minute)**: append a `### Session Start` block to the task:
  - `session_id`, `start_time`, `goal`, `links` (board card, baseline INDE
