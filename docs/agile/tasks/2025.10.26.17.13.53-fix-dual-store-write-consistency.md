# Fix Dual Store Write Consistency

## Overview
Fix critical issue in DualStoreManager where vector store writes can fail silently while document writes succeed, leading to inconsistent data state.

## Context
Code review revealed critical consistency issue in DualStoreManager:
```typescript
// From dualStore.ts lines 86-117
const dualWrite = (process.env.DUAL_WRITE_ENABLED ?? 'true').toLowerCase() !== 'false';
if (dualWrite && (!isImage || this.supportsImages)) {
  try {
    await this.chromaCollection.add({...}); // Vector store
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Failed to embed entry', e); // Silent failure!
  }
}
// Always write to MongoDB
await collection.insertOne({...});
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove silent failures in dual write operations
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add consistency checks between vector and document stores
- [ ] Provide clear error reporting for failed operations
- [ ] Add configuration for write consistency levels

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Implement proper error handling for vector writes
2. **Phase 2**: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Phase 3**: Implement consistency verification
4. **Phase 4**: Add configuration options for consistency levels
5. **Phase 5**: Add comprehensive error reporting

## Technical Details
### Issues to Fix
- Silent failures in ChromaDB writes
- No verification of successful embeddings
- Inconsistent data state between stores
- Poor error visibility and debugging

### Solution Approach
- Implement transaction-like behavior where possible
- Add write verification and consistency checks
- Provide clear error messages and recovery options
- Add configurable consistency levels (eventual vs strong)

## Dependencies
- None (can be implemented independently)

## Risks
- Performance impact of consistency checks
- Backward compatibility with existing data
- Error handling complexity
