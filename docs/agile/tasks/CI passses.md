# Description

A man can dream can't he?
we had to do it... we had to reorganize this. It was getting too much. Shared modules, what was I thinking doing that?
No shared modules. Everything is a package, some packages are different than others.

we're still in the inbetween step where we are needing to distinguish between packages in different run times.

But operating systems don't do that. They require manifests, stuff to get it set up.
Boring work has never been my strong suit.
But we're trying.
