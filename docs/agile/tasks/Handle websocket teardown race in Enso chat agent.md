`EnsoChatAgent.dispose()` currently awaits `wsHandle.close()`, which rejects with “WebSocket was closed before the connection
was established” when shutdown runs before the handshake finishes. AVA reports this as an uncaught exception during
`pnpm nx test @promethean/cephalon`.

## Background
- The cephalon test suite tears down quickly after starting the agent, so the race reproduces frequently.
- The websocket handle should tolerate teardown during connection startup.

## Exit Criteria
- Make `dispose()` resilient to websocket close races (e.g., swallow the specific premature-close error).
- Ensure teardown always resolves without bubbling an uncaught rejection.
- Add coverage for disposing the agent before the websocket fully opens.
