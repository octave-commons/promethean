## Issue

Build failures due to missing DS (Data Science) package dependencies/modules that other packages are trying to import.

## Technical Details

### Current Problem
- Multiple packages are attempting to import modules from a DS package
- The DS package is missing exported modules or not properly built
- This causes TypeScript compilation failures across the monorepo

### Error Pattern
```
Cannot find module '@promethean/ds/[module-name]' or its corresponding type declarations
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Identify which DS package modules are missing
2. Ensure DS package properly exports required modules
3. Fix any package.json dependency declarations
4. Verify DS package builds successfully
5. Confirm all dependent packages can import required modules
6. Ensure full monorepo build completes without errors

## Files to Modify

- `packages/ds/package.json` (fix dependencies and exports)
- `packages/ds/src/index.ts` (ensure proper module exports)
- Any packages importing DS modules (verify import paths)

## Root Cause Analysis

The DS package appears to be incomplete or has missing exports, causing downstream packages to fail during compilation. This could be due to:

1. Missing module exports in the DS package's index file
2. Incorrect package.json exports configuration
3. Missing build scripts or compilation issues
4. Dependency resolution problems

## Verification Steps

1. Build DS package: `pnpm --filter @promethean/ds build`
2. Check exported modules: `ls -la packages/ds/dist/`
3. Verify import paths in dependent packages
4. Run full repository build: `pnpm build`
5. Check for any remaining module resolution errors
6. Validate CI pipeline builds successfully

## Additional Notes

This is a blocking issue for the monorepo build system and needs to be resolved before other build fixes can be properly validated.
