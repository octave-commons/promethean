## 🛠️ Description

This is kinda started through the heartbeat server, but t hat is not nearly robust enough.

This process has been started. We'll be concrete about that much.

There is a centralized process that can be used to collect information about this.

Processes need to be  able to clean up after  themselves. At least the   node  ones. Cause  node has the mechanisims to do it easier.

The heart beat server  will  prevent the  danglers from lasting for too long (assuming it works on windows, I don't know exactly.)
