## Summary
- Workflow provider contains dozens of unused imports and invalid conversions (ChatRequest -> Record<string, unknown>, Markdown AST casts).
- Impact: `pnpm build` remains red for @promethean-os/pantheon-workflow.

## Failure Evidence
- TS6133 for many provider symbols
- TS2352 for ChatRequest and Markdown conversions

## Required Actions
1. Prune dead imports and tighten types for provider helpers
2. Validate `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/pantheon-workflow build`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build command `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/pantheon-workflow build` completes without errors
- Root `pnpm build` no longer reports this package as failing
- Tests or smoke checks relevant to @promethean-os/pantheon-workflow pass
