## 🚨 Process Violation Found

### Code Review Assessment (2025-10-15)
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS ADDITIONAL WORK  
**Issue**: Security framework exists but not integrated with indexer-service  
**Impact**: Validation logic is present but not being used by target service  

### Required Actions
- [ ] Integrate security framework with indexer-service
- [ ] Ensure validation is actually called by service endpoints
- [ ] Add integration tests for framework usage
- [ ] Verify end-to-end security coverage

### Process Notes
- Security implementation is high-quality but lacks integration
- Framework needs to be connected to actual service endpoints
- Must complete integration before moving to testing phase
