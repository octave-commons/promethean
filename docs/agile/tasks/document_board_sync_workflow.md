## 🛠️ Task: Document board sync workflow

After the sync script exists, we need clear instructions on how to use it and how the GitHub Projects board maps to our local kanban.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide step-by-step usage instructions
- Explain column mappings and limitations
- Encourage contributors to keep both boards in sync

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [x] Add documentation under `docs/` describing setup
- [x] Include example command invocations
- [x] Mention required GitHub permissions

---

## 📋 Subtasks

- [x] Write README section or new doc
- [x] Describe expected workflow
- [x] Link to the sync script

---

## ✅ Completion Notes

Created comprehensive `docs/agile/board_sync.md` documentation covering:

- **Architecture overview** of bidirectional sync between local kanban and GitHub
- **Automated workflows** (daily sync, GitHub Issues sync)
- **Manual operations** with CLI commands and examples
- **Configuration** details for environment variables and process YAML
- **Column mappings** between kanban statuses and GitHub labels
- **Required permissions** and troubleshooting guide
- **Best practices** for maintaining sync integrity

The documentation provides complete setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting guidance for contributors to effectively use the board sync system.
