## Context

This epic consolidates 5 boardrev enhancement tasks into a cohesive AI-powered code review system. The goal is to transform boardrev from a basic manual review tool into an intelligent, automated review system with vector-based semantic search and multi-model evaluation.

## Scope

**Core Components:**

1. **Vector Database Migration** - Replace LevelDB with proper vector DB
2. **Multi-Model Evaluation** - Support multiple AI models for review
3. **Confidence Tracking** - Calibrate and track review accuracy
4. **Context Analysis** - Weighted factors for better relevance
5. **Pipeline Integration** - Connect with piper automation
6. **Interactive Management** - Auto-updates and task management

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Vector database abstraction layer implemented
- [ ] Multi-model evaluation framework with model switching
- [ ] Confidence calibration system with historical tracking
- [ ] Weighted context analysis for relevance scoring
- [ ] Piper pipeline integration for automated reviews
- [ ] Interactive task management with auto-updates
- [ ] Migration tools from existing LevelDB data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing improvement
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all components

## Technical Implementation

**Phase 1: Infrastructure**

- Vector DB abstraction (Chroma/Pinecone/Weaviate support)
- Migration scripts from LevelDB
- Performance benchmarking suite

**Phase 2: AI Enhancement**

- Multi-model evaluation framework
- Confidence tracking and calibration
- Weighted context analysis algorithms

**Phase 3: Integration**

- Piper pipeline connectors
- Interactive task management UI
- Auto-update mechanisms

**Phase 4: Optimization**

- Performance tuning
- Advanced filtering capabilities
- Documentation and training materials

## Acceptance Criteria

- System handles repositories 10x larger than current limit
- Review quality improves with confidence tracking
- Automated pipeline integration reduces manual effort
- Multi-model support provides review options
- Interactive management improves user experience
- All existing functionality preserved during migration

## Dependencies

- Vector database service (self-hosted or cloud)
- AI model API access for evaluation
- Pipeline system integration points
- Performance monitoring and metrics
