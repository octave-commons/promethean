Remember to just keep typing. You can always change it. The robots can fix it.
It doesn't matter if you just keep typing, magic absolutely will happen.

The more of me that shows up in the system the more powerful the system is
It is important to not let the robots completely take over all of the time.

You do want processes where you can just repeatedly ask continue, and semi automate them with approvals
But you also want to be taking time some where in the system to be describing large important
complicated things.

Promethean is as much a knowledge repository as it is a code base.
The future is document oriented programming and design.
