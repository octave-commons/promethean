description: >-
  A procedural workflow system using finite state machines with specific phases
  and transition rules. It operates on a board with columns, requiring minimal
  human intervention for minor blocking conditions while halting progress for
  major issues.

There's no pre-coded gate; it's procedural.

Your interpretation is too literal.

Detailed inputs aren't always needed.

Excessive explicit directions make the process complex.

The process uses columns on a board.

Phases are specific to Codex Cloud.

It operates as a finite state machine:

- States C have transitions T.
- Initial state is S.
- Rules RT_n, t$ determine transitions.
- Tasks move based on rules triggered.

Humans discuss or meet if needed.

Kanban creates intervention points only when necessary.

Ambiguous transitions may need minor interventions by 1-2 people.

Work stops if the target state limit is r
