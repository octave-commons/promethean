## Summary
- Plugin SDK fails with unused symbols, unsafe conversions to Partial<T>, sandbox APIs referencing missing fields, and Record<string, unknown> assignments to rich objects.
- Impact: `pnpm build` remains red for @promethean-os/plugin-hooks.

## Failure Evidence
- TS6196/TS6138 for EventBus/HookRegistry/context
- TS2352 conversions in plugin-sdk
- TS2339: Property 'pluginStats' does not exist on sandbox state

## Required Actions
1. Clean up unused exports and model plugin stats in shared types
2. Tighten security-manager return types to avoid Record<string, unknown> casts
3. Rebuild

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build command `pnpm --filter @promethean-os/plugin-hooks build` completes without errors
- Root `pnpm build` no longer reports this package as failing
- Tests or smoke checks relevant to @promethean-os/plugin-hooks pass
