## 🛠️ Description

We want to keep our community safe in both discord and twitch. We want our system to automaticly moderate content in our social media. We want to timeout users if they break the rules. We want a formally defined set of rules. We want to ban users who repeatedly break rules. We want the system to learn the rules abstractly like a person would, 

We want a system that's kinda like twitches auto mod, but for discord, and just generally better
