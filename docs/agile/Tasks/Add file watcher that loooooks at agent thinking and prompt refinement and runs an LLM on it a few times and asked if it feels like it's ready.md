## 🛠️ Description

Add file watcher that loooooks at agent thinking and prompt refinement and runs an LLM on it a few times and asked if it feels like it's ready

Ready for "agent thinking" would be like "It's clear what the intent is"
Ready for Prompt refinement is  "There is a general outline of how this connects to things and how it might be done"

Breakdown is "Is this too big?"  or "Could this be done along side another task" It is about complexity management.
