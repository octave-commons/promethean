## 🛠️ Description

This isn't the eidolon fields, but some nessisary tooling for them to do their job correctly.

Stuff has to be able to move in and out of the allowable context in phases.

There has to be like "Working" memory (stuff that is recent and is just staying in memory)
"Recent" (Stuff that could be relavent  because it was recent, but may not be. It can fall out of context, but is still queryable, probably still held in memory. In a cache)

"Important" These  could be old, but remain relavent. 

This issue isn't about strictly defining these, but to provide mechanisims for them. Cacheing levels of various sizes that memory falls in and out of.

kinda like L1, L2, L3, RAM, swap,  hdd, net fs, so on.
The further away it is, the harder it is to get.

But still accessable.
