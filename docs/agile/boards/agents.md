## Board workflow & migration
- Migrate server-side Sibilant libraries to the Promethean architecture and annotate legacy code with migration tags
- Develop tools such as a smart task templater and integrate Ollama; consider starting the Eidolon subsystem
- Build utilities for fragment ingestion, memory-contradiction detection, and metaprogramming updates
- Create foundational documentation and tooling, including README templates, Babashka/Nx automation notes for JS/TS, GitHub-compatible markdown settings, and an Obsidian↔GitHub board mirror system
- Finalize `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, mirror the vault structure to match code directories, and add vault onboarding docs and `.obsidian/` gitignore entries
- Explore concepts such as Eidolon field structures, transcendence cascades, and board-sync or GitHub Projects workflows

## Eidolon field & error handling
- Prototype an exception-event schema, classifier, and diagnostic logging UI to visualize exception flows
- Classify error messages, project them into the Eidolon field, and create a library of error patterns; wire a test agent into this system
- Develop a 2D field sandbox with potential extensions like Sibilant ports, real-time visualization, or particle-type experiments
- Generalize the field engine to N dimensions with optional CLI visualization and snapshot serialization
- Enhance the Node.js visual simulation with velocity-based coloring, multiple field nodes, trails or heatmaps, and higher-dimensional projections
- Build resource monitoring agents and a stress-field system, including a resource snapshot collector, 2D vector stress map, agent responses, stress injector, and self-healing demo

## Interface and runtime improvements
- Extract and classify parenthetical phrases to drive context-aware pauses in speech output
- Design a Windows-native tiling environment using Komorebi, a custom group manager, and WSL as a headless service layer for tasks like file indexing and AI data preparation
