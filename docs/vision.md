# 🌌 Promethean Project Vision

The **Promethean Framework** is a modular cognitive architecture designed to host a diverse ecosystem of embodied AI agents. Unlike traditional assistants, Promethean emphasizes **embodied reasoning, perception-action loops, and emotionally mediated decision-making**, enabling agents to act as *residents* within a shared environment rather than isolated scripts.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles
- **Modularity** — Break down intelligence into specialized services (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, memory, reasoning, emotion).
- **Embodiment** — Agents operate as if situated in the world, with continuity of memory, multimodal perception, and action.
- **Emotion & Affect** — Cognitive processes are influenced by simulated emotional states, producing more adaptive and relatable behavior.
- **Extensibility** — Any developer can define new agents or services, scaling Promethean into a multi-agent ecosystem.

---

## 🛤️ Long-Term Goals
1. Establish a robust **service ecosystem** for language, perception, and memory.
2. Support **multiple resident agents** (e.g. Duck, Codex) coexisting with distinct personalities and roles.
3. Integrate **multimodal interfaces** (speech, text, images, dashboards) into real-time interaction flows.
4. Provide developer-friendly tooling for creating, monitoring, and evolving agents.
5. Move toward **persistent, evolving agents** that can adapt over weeks and months, not just sessions.

## 📍 Current Milestones
- Migration of legacy Sibilant/Python code into Hy & TypeScript.
- Stabilization of service generators and kanban automation scripts.
- Development of specialized agents (Duck as exemplar).
- Integration of emotional simulation with reasoning services.
- Tooling for observability, dashboards, and real-time monitoring.

> ✨ Promethean envisions a living system of AI residents, each unique, but all sharing the same architectural foundation. The framework’s purpose is not to build one assistant — but to **seed a community of agents that grow, evolve, and collaborate**.
