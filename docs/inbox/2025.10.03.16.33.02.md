Ok, the command you gave me returns:
```
err:~/devel/promethean$   curl -N \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
    -d '{
          "jsonrpc":"2.0",
          "id":1,
          "method":"initialize",
          "params":{
            "protocolVersion":"2024-10-01",
            "capabilities":{},
            "clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"0.0.1"}
          }
        }' \
    http://localhost:3210/playwright/mcp
event: message
data: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{"tools":{}},"serverInfo":{"name":"Playwright","version":"0.0.41"}}}
```

But chatgpt's interface is still returning:
```
Error creating connector
