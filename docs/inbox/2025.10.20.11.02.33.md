Plus, it provides a new way of creating agents, unique to pantheon.
context from all stores is easily formatted in OpenAI style message arrays
construct agent context from inputs dynamicly.
instead of a single rolling history that gets compacted
context is generated from semantic search over any number of data sources of your choosing.
The agent can it's self also choose to select a data store for it's history to be generated from

Agents naturally share state this way, as history is shared between all of them,
and it is access based on it's goals and recent actions.


Agents are spawned as named entities called `Actors` with roles assigned to them.


Actors read from a script defined in a Lisp DSL
Actors are persistant entities in the pantheon system.
Actors have both passive and active behavior.

Behaviors are like:
- research
- review code,
- review documentation
- review tasks
- add comments
- pseudo code
- work on a task
- write tasks for the board
- update tasks
- pair with another agent

Any behavior can be defined as being allowable in either state.

Passive behaviors are actions your actor will take in the background
You set a list of allowed active behaviors
