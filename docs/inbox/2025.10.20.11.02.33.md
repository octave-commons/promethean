# Pantheon Agent Management Framework

We've got a lot of code all over the place, many designs.
It starts to come together as something unique here


## Motivation

so I'm thinking I want to finally use this agent framework for something.
I want all of this agent code, consolidated down to the `@promethean/pantheon` package

I've been working on all of this agent related stuff in `@promethen/opencode-client` as
an agent orchestration/intercommunication thing,
but what I really want is something more abstract.

## Desrciption

The pantheon management framework centralizes abstractions for agents across various platforms.
it is a unified interface that allows you to create, define, and manage agents from any platform.
It provides a centralized CLI and UI for managing agent sessions.
lingustic and symbolic search across any agent session.
a single unified format for creating agents that can be used in any platform.
A single unified format for creating and managing tools used in any platform.
A single unified format for using MCP servers in any platform.
facilitates inter-agent communication

## Pantheon natives

Plus, it provides a new way of creating agents, unique to pantheon.
context from all stores is easily formatted in OpenAI style message arrays
construct agent context from inputs dynamicly.
instead of a single rolling history that gets compacted
context is generated from semantic search over any number of data sources of your choosing.
The agent can it's self also choose to select a data store for it's history to be generated from

Agents naturally share state this way, as history is shared between all of them,
and it is access based on it's goals and recent actions.


Agents are spawned as named entities called `Actors` with roles assigned to them.


Actors read from a script defined in a Lisp DSL
Actors are persistent entities in the pantheon system.
Actors have both passive, active, and persistent behaviors.
Actors have
Active behaviors are allowable in direct response to user input.
Passive behaviors are allowable when no direct input has been given to be acted on.

Persistent behaviors are always allowed


Behaviors are like:
- research
- review code,
- review documentation
- review tasks
- add comments
- pseudo code
- work on a task
- write tasks for the board
- update tasks
- pair with another agent


For each actor, a list of allowable passive, active, and peristent behaviors are available.

Actors context is managed differently than most agents.
Actors have a dynamic context.
This means that through sue of a 


Set's of related behaviors are called "talents"

Behaviors, talents are defined as a part of the actors scripts

Actor's scripts can be one off, unique to them, or they can be defined abstractly with roles.
A role is a collection of behaviors, talents, context sources, and logic which
can be reused between agents with similar responsibilities

Since Actors are long running processes, each actor must have a unique name.

## Importing and export agents from other agentic tool kits

Pantheon can import and export actors as agents for:
- claude
- opencode
- openai sdk (we are built on top of it)
