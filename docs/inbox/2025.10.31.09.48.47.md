## Epic: Fix Kanban Move Tests - Transition Rules & Board Loading

Description: Resolve failing kanban move command tests caused by missing transition rules configuration and
improper board file error handling.

### Tasks

1. ✅ Analyze failing test output and root causes (completed)
 • Identified 6 failing tests with transition rules and board loading issues
2. 🔲 Inspect test files and expectations (high priority)
 • Examine failing test files to understand expected behavior
 • Review test setup and fixture requirements
3. 🔲 Trace transition rules engine initialization (high priority)
 • Analyze transition rules loading and fallback behavior
 • Understand why Clojure DSL is required but missing
4. 🔲 Check board loading and error handling (high priority)
 • Review kanban-compatibility.ts for ENOENT handling
 • Determine proper error handling for missing board files
5. 🔲 Create test fixtures (Clojure DSL + config) (high priority)
 • Create minimal Clojure DSL file for transition rules
 • Create promethean.kanban.json test configuration
6. 🔲 Fix missing board file handling (medium priority)
 • Improve error handling for non-existent board files
 • Ensure graceful degradation in test scenarios
7. 🔲 Update tests to use fixtures (high priority)
 • Modify tests to load proper configuration
 • Update test expectations to match transition rules
8. 🔲 Run tests and verify fixes (high priority)
 • Execute test suite to confirm all tests pass
 • Validate transition rules are applied correctly
9. 🔲 Add regression tests (medium priority)
 • Create tests to prevent future regressions
 • Ensure configuration loading is robust
10. 🔲 Update documentation (low priority)
 • Document test configuration requirements
 • Update README with setup instructions


### Key Issues Identified

• Transition Rules Missing: Tests fail because Clojure DSL path is required but not provided
• Board File Errors: ENOENT errors when loading non-existent board files
• Configuration Loading: Multiple failed attempts to load promethean.kanban.json
• Test Expectations: Tests expect transitions (Todo → In Progress) but rules aren't loaded

### Success Criteria

• All 6 failing tests pass
• Transition rules engine loads correctly in tests
• Board file errors are handled gracefully
• Test suite is deterministic and self-contained

Ready to proceed with Task 2: Inspect test files and expectations.
