There are some quirks to be aware of then adding metadata to a [linked note](https://publish.obsidian.md/kanban/Settings/Linked+page+metadata). Links and image embeds must be wrapped in quotes, for example, to show up as [Linked page metadata](https://publish.obsidian.md/kanban/Settings/Linked+page+metadata). In general, if you have trouble getting frontmatter fields to display in a card, try wrapping it in quotes.
