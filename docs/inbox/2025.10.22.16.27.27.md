The point of the context store is to simplify searching for a common term over many data sources.
So the tool should probably allow them to give the full set of argumenets to "compileContext" though compile
context is designed specifically to return openai style chat message context for building those sorts of queries.
Every plugin should return markdown, instead of json. Every action should return raw objects, and allow the
consumer to handle serialization.

Add a new tool for searching that uses the compileCoontext function, so agents have the ability to search semanticly with rich metadata filtering.
