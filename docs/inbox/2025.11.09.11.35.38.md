What if we set up a thing that went through the build error report line by line and executed `cd <package> && opencode run 'fix <error>'`
We still have to test if the file locking is working as intended
we sketched out an embedded in memory redjs cacheing system in perplexity
With that I think that plugin becomes publishable.

Where are my thoughts?
is it just the road? too much passing by me to grasp onto it
just visiting, just passing by, seeing idea's along the side of the road...
