• I’m outlining recommendations for system tasks based on the README, focusing on grammar formalization, telemetry, markdown conversion, and watcher tests. For Cephalon, I’ll highlight its PoC status, dependencies on API naming docs, and outstanding persistence and test coverage tasks that need follow-up.

• I'm reviewing tasks related to shared audio quantization, docops link bugs, and Mermaid diagram consolidation. I'll also coordinate updates to READMEs and scripts while preparing clear next-step instructions using numbered lists, keeping the tone friendly and referencing relevant backlog notes for context.

• Kanban Review

  - Reviewed open checklist in docs/notes/2025.10.06.23.14.03.md:1; backlog sits at 325 todo vs 19 in_progress, so avoid starting more work until high-impact cards move.
  - Put docs/agile/tasks/implement-kanban-dev-command-with-real-time-sync-and-ui-hosting.md:1 (P1) at the front—live feedback on the board will accelerate every other UI change.
  - Sync with docs/agile/tasks/Setup Kanban UI for Kanban package.md:1 $P3, in_progress$ before adding new UI polish to prevent duplicate scaffolding.
  - Clear agent friction by finishing docs/agile/tasks/fix-kanban-config-path-resolution-and-documentation.md:1; path confusion is still a top support issue.
  - Pair the refactor in docs/agile/tasks/move-board-tools-into-kanban-package.md:1 with hygiene from docs/agile/tasks/update-kanban-statuses-to-fsm.md:1 so automation stays trustworthy.

  Pipeline Triage

  - docs/agile/tasks/configure-piper-environment-variables-for-ai-pipelines.md:1 (P1) is the gating item—no other AI-assisted pipeline stabilizes until env vars and OLLAMA defaults are codified.
  - Land docs/agile/tasks/fix-piper-pipeline-caching.md:1 $P2, in_progress$ to stop stale caches from masking later fixes.
  - Unblock DocOps by addressing docs/agile/tasks/fix-docops-pipeline-file-reference-management-and-sequencing.md:1; the ENOENT failure halts end-to-end runs.
  - Restore scanning accuracy with docs/agile/tasks/fix-simtasks-pipeline-missing-package-references-and-scanning-errors.md:1 and docs/agile/tasks/fix-semverguard-pipeline-incorrect-directory-scanning-and-configuration-issues.md:1.
  - Queue docs/agile/tasks/optimize-piper-pipeline-performance-and-add-timeouts.md:1 once the above land to prevent regressions during longer runs.

  System Core Tasks

  - system/README.md:1 calls for a defined DSL; spin up a task to formalize the markdown grammar and parser so agents stop guessing at semantics.
  - Add a task to capture confirmation telemetry and optimization triggers described around daemon/condition workflows $system/README.md:24$.
  - Plan a pipeline task that automates markdown→structured conversion once confirmation thresholds are met, matching the optimization flow outlined in the README.
  - Schedule unit/contract tests for triggers, schedules, and actions to ensure pm2-managed daemons behave predictably before wiring new automations.

  Cephalon Status

  - Package remains PoC $packages/cephalon/README.md:1$; unblock API clarity via docs/agile/tasks/enso-rationale-payload-and-event-name.md:1 (P2).
  - History + persistence are still gaps: docs/agile/tasks/cephalon_backfill_conversation_history.md:1 and docs/agile/tasks/cephalon_tests_for_persistence_and_ecs.md:1 should be next once feature work pauses.
  - Integration tests such as packages/cephalon/src/tests/voice_session_artifacts.integration.test.ts:1 still rely on legacy storage assumptions—update after persistence tasks land.
  - Keep execution path aligned with docs/agile/tasks/cephalon_feature_flag_path_selection.md:1 while the feature-flag rewrite proceeds.

  Duck Status

  - Browser stack is healthy $packages/duck-web/README.md:1$; prioritize the in-progress P1s docs/agile/tasks/pcm16k-worklet-and-mic-fixes.md:1, docs/agile/tasks/duck-feature-flags-rewrite-web-node-docs.md:1, and docs/agile/tasks/openws-helper-wrap-and-guards.md:1.
  - Move docs/agile/tasks/duck-audio-shared-clamp-and-constants.md:1 up—shared quantization is prerequisite for cross-platform parity.
  - Keep diagrams/documentation synchronized via docs/agile/tasks/duck-revival-diagrams-and-docs.md:1 as large audio changes ship.
  - Remember to run the AVA suite defined in packages/duck-web/package.json:8 after each audio or transport tweak.

  DocOps & Mermaid

  - The link-creation regression most likely sits in packages/docops/src/convert-wikilinks.ts:29; record a failing sample + regression test before coding the fix.
  - Use the sequencing work in docs/agile/tasks/fix-docops-pipeline-file-reference-management-and-sequencing.md:1 to anchor the link bug once reproduced.
  - Mermaid diagrams are scattered $README.md:240, packages/schema/README.md:24, packages/cephalon/docs/graph/cephalon-knowledge.md:26$; draft a consolidation task to catalog and normalize flows.
  - scripts/generate-roadmap-site.ts:19 already scrapes mermaid blocks—extend it to emit an inventory report as the first consolidation step.

  1. Run pnpm kanban update_status <uuid> in_progress on whichever Kanban/UI task you adopt so the board reflects the hand-off.
  2. After reshuffling pipeline priorities, execute pnpm kanban regenerate to broadcast the new ordering across task files.
  3. Once you capture a docops link reproduction, add a dedicated task file with the failing case and planned regression test before touching code.
