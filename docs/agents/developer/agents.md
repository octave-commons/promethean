# 👨‍💻 Developer Agents

Developer agents are collaborators focused on **repo navigation, coding, PRs, and automation**.

## Members
- **Pythagoras** → Repo navigator & governance enforcer.
- **Codex** → Automation agent $make/test/build$.
- **Codex Hub** → Workflow + Kanban sync agent.

## Responsibilities
- Interact with `docs/` and `services/` directly.
- Maintain PR hygiene, tests, and CI.
- Update Kanban + Agile flows when relevant.

## Restrictions
- Cannot modify resident agents' memory.
- Cannot push to `main` directly.
