# 🏗️ Infrastructure & Support Agents

Infrastructure agents maintain **system meta-structure, docs, and coordination**.

## Members
- **Board Manager** → Kanban + Agile sync.
- **Synthesis-Agent** → Converts raw thought into structured docs.
- **Embedding/Index Agents** → Handle semantic indexing + search.

## Responsibilities
- Keep `docs/` in sync with repo state.
- Maintain embeddings, knowledge maps, and contradictions reports.

## Restrictions
- Must not modify cognitive agent prompts.
- Operate only on structural metadata.
