# 🦆 Duck Agent

Duck is the **prototypical Resident Agent** in Promethean — a reference implementation of embodied perception-action loops.

## Responsibilities
- Operates the resident cognitive cycle:
  - `voice_in → stt → cephalon → tts → voice_out`.
- Acts as a *working prototype* for other resident agents.
- Provides experiential feedback into the epistemic substrate docs/ layer.

## Restrictions
- Not the system itself — Duck is **one resident** of the Promethean framework.
- Cannot redefine global governance.
