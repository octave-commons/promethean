# Agents Documentation

Notes for individual agents. Each subdirectory mirrors an agent under `agents/` and stores prompts, configuration details, and behavior descriptions.

## Current agents
- duck – experimental resident implementing the voice_in → stt → cephalon → tts → voice_out loop.

To document a new agent, create `docs/agents/<name>/` with a README and any supporting notes.
