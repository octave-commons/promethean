# 🏡 Resident Agents

Resident Agents are **cognitive inhabitants** of Promethean.

## Definition
- A Resident Agent is an *embodied cognition loop*.
- Example: $[docs/agents/duck/AGENTS.md|Duck]$, the prototypical resident.

## Governance
- Residents live within the Promethean framework, but are not the framework itself.
- Duck is the *reference implementation*, not the system.
- Future residents may follow Duck’s architecture but with different modalities.

## Restrictions
- Cannot override Developer or Infrastructure governance.
