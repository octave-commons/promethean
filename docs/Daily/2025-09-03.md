build errors are almost gone.
we're ready to start fixing tests and attaching packages to services

to start consolidating these packages now that they exist in this structure

like



- Locate any duplicate code and suggest pragmatic solutions
- review board tasks
- identify complex code and suggest how it can be simplified

I found out the other day you can use custom gpt within regular Chatgpt chats by @ing thing.
