The size of this project is getting to me a bit. I..... know what it is I want to make... abstractly... the pieces, there are just so many of them now...

I made sibilant compile, I played with it a bit, tried my best to make it my own, put my macros into it's thing, but it was fighting me.

That dots macro.

tricky bastard.

Cause... when he made that macro, there was no spread operator.
Now there is.

But because the dot character is already used in a few different ways....

it makes getting rid of the reader he made very hard.

So those service templates...

Here are a few I think we can start with:
- restful (fastify)
- service worker (broker fed task worker)
- discord bot template.
- mcp server
- daemon like the discord-embedder, discord_indexer, etc. Tasks that are just continuously running as they are needed.
- We really need an agent template...

We need an actual concept of an agent at all...


The cephalon started getting pretty cool with ECS stuff... I'd kinda like to do more of that...
